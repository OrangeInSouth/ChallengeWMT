Over the last few weeks it has become evident that are many skeletons in relation to racial discrimination in South African sport.
Former Proteas batting star Ashwell Prince has lashed out at his former white team mates, accusing them of racial bias by labelling him and other black squad members as "quota players."
Adding that it is sad that even when black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada who ascended to the pinnacle of the game, they still have the quota tag attached to them by some people.

According to the CBS report, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request concerning Gunter's potential carrying of arms had been received from the United States, as the government does not comment on the security arrangements of foreign diplomats.

The bigger is better philosophy clearly rang true for the new owners of a sprawling Lovely Banks property that's just sold for $1.277m.
"It was the combination of the lifestyle property, being three acres, and it's right there," Mr Grgic said.
The CBS report also addresses the various problems around the US Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed last year, including the fact that he has already replaced seven Deputy Chiefs of Mission.
The first deputy is said to have prepared extensively, including learning Icelandic, only to be refused the post at the last minute because Gunter "didn't like the look of him" at their first meeting.
In February, after attending a conference in Washington, Gunter allegedly refused to return to Iceland, leaving a temporary deputy in charge of his post for months, in the middle of a pandemic.
The CBS report also notes Gunter's unpopularity in Iceland, particularly in relation to a heavily criticised tweet where he referred to the coronavirus as "the invisible China Virus".

Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as a UFC star-in-waiting after making history on Fight Island, but the Russian-born fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of Conor McGregor.
Chimaev overwhelmed Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in their welterweight contest in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, finishing his opponent with a ground-and-pound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round.
The win ensured Chimaev etched his name into the UFC history books by claiming the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion, coming just 10 days after he defeated Britain's John Phillips in similarly destructive fashion - on that occasion at middleweight.
The 8-0 Chimaev pocketed a $50,000 Performance-of-the-Night bonus for his work against McKee and has firmly earned the attention of the MMA world, being tipped as 'Khabib 2.0' - a perhaps inevitable comparison given Chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the UFC lightweight champ, and was born in Chechnya, which neighbors Khabib's own Dagestani homeland.
Despite the newfound fame and financial boost, the softly-spoken Chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of MMA money-man Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent Floyd Mayweather Jr.
One man he has gained the attention of is Conor McGregor teammate and arch Twitter protagonist Dillon Danis, who took to the platform to claim he could submit Chimaev "easily."
That drew a withering response from the fighter known as 'Borz' - or 'wolf' in his native Chechen - who said he would "smash Danis with his eyes closed."
Chimaev, who now fights out of Stockholm, Sweden, having moved to the country at the age of 19, may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects.
"I can smash everybody...
I can smash all of them," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos (welterweight) champion, 84 kilos (middleweight) champion, I'm going to smash both of them, same day."

50 People To Be Allowed In Mosques On Eid, No Mass Prayers In Eidgah: Karnataka
The Karnataka government has allowed Eid-ul-Azha prayers only in mosques with a maximum of 50 people at a time and said mass prayers at Eidgah and other places are prohibited in view of the coronavirus pandemic.
If there were more people, the prayers should be performed in batches, the department said in the order.
Mass prayers should not be performed in any other places such as halls, community buildings and "Shadi Mahal," the order added.
Karnataka allowed temples, mosques and other places of worship to be open for devotees from June 8 with all COVID-19 preventive measures in place.
CBS Television published a report on the matter on its website this morning, quoting Washington sources who maintain that Gunter is paranoid, insisting on carrying arms himself, getting a stab-proof vest and having an armed security detail, as well as a bullet-proof car.

US Racial Injustice Protests Mount
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in Iceland last Thursday, each with their own variant of the virus.
A sequence analysis by deCODE Genetics revealed that the two connected persons who were diagnosed with the virus have a new variant that has not been diagnosed before in this country.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and acting Chief Epidemiologist, says that deCODE Genetics is now reviewing the mostly likely origin of this type of the virus.
"Yes, it's so unlike what has been found here before that there's really no likelihood of it having been brewing here," answers Kamilla.
"Instead, everything points to these persons having come into some contact with a person who has just arrived from overseas, without them being aware of it themselves."
We will be watching this closely over the next few days."
Do you assume that there are community-acquired infections now?
We have not seen them recently but it cannot be ruled out because we don't know who may have infected the persons who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday," she replies.
Thus, you can expect Landspítali's bacterial and virology department to increase testing in the coming days in order to better map out the domestic situation.
It should come as no surprise that there have been reports of people flying to Iceland with the express purpose of visiting it.

A giant from Kristnipollur in Laxá in Dalir
The first 100 cm salmon in Laxá in Dalir was caught this afternoon.
He had caught an 89 cm long female in Kristnipollur.
Kristnipollur became available to him again in the afternoon, and he was reminded of a story he had heard about how the male often took the bait after the female had been caught.
With this in mind, he cast his fly, a Collie Dog, over Kristnipollur.
He soon detected a strike, and in his own words:
"In about five seconds, it cleared itself completely and I realised that it was a one-metre fish.
I was a little stressed out as I had an eleven-pound leader.
I usually pull hard on fish but I worked on this one for forty minutes.
In fact, he was rather easy to deal with.
He took a few trips up and down the hole before I managed to land it, which was a wonderful feeling.
I threw the rod away and jumped on it.
It measured at 102 cm and I measured it twice," said the happy angler when Sporðaköst caught up with him in the fishing lodge Þrándargil at Laxá í Dalir.

The Glee curse - the tragic fate of the Glee stars
According to a theory that has caught on online, there is a curse on the television series Glee, with actress Naya Rivera's recent drowning death in California making her the third lead actor in the series to die long before their time.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of no-nonsense cheerleader Santana Lopez in the series.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the voice of angel who played a major role in Glee's success.
Moneith subsequently entered rehab and everything seemed to be heading in the right direction.
The cause of death turned out to be a fatal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
The death was not believed to be intentional.

"I don't think there's many of us sailors working in the country's preschools," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is an inshore fisherman in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland in winter.
My income also lasts well into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year old psychology student who works as an inshore fisherman this summer, like in previous summers.
Hartmann was getting on in years and had retired from fishing by the time I bought his boat, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.

I learned about these spots out here in the west from going fishing with my dad.
I have also gone fishing down south, but then it's mainly lumpfish," says Axel, who always sails out alone in the very early hours of the morning and says that he'll sometimes talk to the seagulls and sing to the sky in his hours of solitude in the middle of the ocean.
"In inshore fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing according to other systems, the hired quota system, for instance, where I have been out at sea fishing for one and a half days without interruption.
He says that according to the inshore fishing arrangement, he's allowed to catch 770 kilos per day, which he feels is restrictive.
There is this unnecessary pressure to go out fishing instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to pick them as you please.
I also wouldn't mind if the division into zones would stop, in which case the fishing villages that are ideally located close to fishing grounds should be allowed to reap the benefits," says Axel, whose main catch in his inshore fishing is cod, along with some saithe and the occasional other species.
During the winter, Axel works at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur alongside his university studies.
Registration error prevented return hygiene measures
That is why the person in question did not receive an automatic summon to be tested.
Kamilla says that despite this, many people observed the rules on return hygiene measures despite filling out the registration form in English and in some instances, employers have also taken care to send people to be tested after their arrival in the country.

Gerður's mosaic will finally come into its own
There is also a big excavator there.
At least not observed it.
There will be a square in front of the mural, and the site is considered well suited as a leisure area for pedestrians due to its advantageous sunlight position.
The mural will be illuminated, enabling a better appreciation of the material on this 142 square metre surface.
Many of these are getting on in age, with the sewage and cold water pipelines dating from the year 1925, thus having served residents and businesses in the city centre for close to a century.
As a dock warehouse extended through the building, there was a 250 square metre windowless wall surface facing the street.
Gerður Helgadóttir had a great reputation as an artist during this period, according to the summary.
When the artist was contacted, she was immediately captivated by the task.
An agreement was reached, and Gerður prepared the mural for installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then oversaw the installation on the Customs House.
The mural has been able to withstand the harsh Icelandic climate ever since.
Prepares to relocate more agencies outside the capital area
The Minister said this on the programme Sprengisandur on Bylgjan at noon today.
The Authority employs six fire safety experts, but none of them intend to move to the north of the country along with the Authority, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers has criticised the relocation.
More relocations," said Ásmundur.
"I think that there have to be more political decisions to relocate government jobs to rural areas, like I just did with the Housing and Construction Authority," said Ásmundur, who also named examples of other institutions that have been relocated outside the capital area and were of great importance to the rural communities, such as the relocation of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and the Unemployment Insurance Payment Office to Skagaströnd.

Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been the subject of much talk, but also admiration for his conduct this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Breiðablik will be in the line of fire tonight, when they host ÍA in a match broadcast live on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur will be banned from playing, due to his four yellow cards during the season, so he won't arrive for the match with a new haircut, like he has done until now at this summer's matches.
"I don't know exactly who he was answering with that haircut, but speaking of character, this one was certainly making an effort during the match.
He wants the ball every single time, and if someone was going to score an equalizer in this game, I thought that he would do it or do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max Discussion when the talk turned to Brynjólfur.
"It's sometimes difficult to see what position he's playing.
People are reading interviews with Brynjólfur, paying admission and waiting to see what his hair will say next.
Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bicycles worth millions - now defends himself after DV's report
Due to this, Bjartmar has been called the "bicycle whisperer".
DV referred to a discussion in a Facebook group for residents in West Reykjavik where Bjartmar was reported to have approached the man on Austurvöllur and said that his scooter was possibly stolen.
The original post from the man on the electric scooter seemed to say that Bjartmar had accused him of theft.
Bjartmar said that he received information from the victim of an electric scooter theft that this was certainly his electric scooter.
"I saw the guy and the scooter was familiar to me, as I had information that this was an electric scooter that had been missing and searched for for a very long time.
I was certainly hesitant at first, but when I saw him prepare to drive away on the scooter, I decided to take the plunge and talk to the man.
I'm generally very subtle in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had interrupted me."
The owner of the electric scooter eventually proved his ownership and rode away.
In the more than a year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says he can count on the fingers of one hand the times he got into altercations with people.
"I have had peaceful interactions with Reykjavik's most difficult men," said Bjartmar and points out that in the vast majority of cases, bicycle thieves are society's most vulnerable brothers and sisters, addicts, people with mental disorders and people who are on the street for some reason.
"Addiction is a merciless taskmaster, the next fix must be funded somehow and unfortunately, stealing these kinds of movable properties is an easy way to reach that goal," says Bjartmar.
There are examples of people going to rehab and straightening themselves out and then coming to me to assist me in what I'm doing," he says.
Bjartmar adds that the police is even beginning to advise people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is displeased with DV's previous reporting and says that he not some kind of vigilante on a personal quest for justice.
When asked whether he isn't going too far in his activities, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, Bjartmar says that that is certainly the case.
They are completely useless in these matters, to tell you the truth."
He says that he has been so successful in finding lost bicycles that sometimes when he has run into his "protégés" on the street, they have simply handed the bicycles that they had snatched over to Bjartmar.
That is largely due to electric scooters, e-bikes and mobility scooters, with electric bikes sometimes costing up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a preschool during the day and at a group home every other weekend.
All these rights were the result of a long and difficult struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much more significant and permanent improvement of employment terms than adding a few coins to the pay envelope, which were immediately lost to the inflation that characterised the post-war period until 1990, as many will remember.
All this is recollected here as an introduction to the latest buzz word in Icelandic, "shadow direction".
As the word is a new one in the language, it has understandably not been fully defined, but it seems to me like the following definition is currently the "most popular pick": Shadow direction is when a trade union leader proclaims in the media that they will give the union's representatives on the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on what position to take on a particular matter.
Failure to follow the recommendation would result in dismissal from the board at the first opportunity.
However, this is not "shadow direction" if the leader does not take this to the media or talk about dismissal, as such communications between people are of course common in the financial world, like elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to decide which method is more "shadowy".
For both of them, the motive arose when Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had told of his intention to terminate the company's agreements with airline hostesses and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, recommended that the union's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Commerce refrained from supporting any purchase of the company's shares by the fund, or else they may be made to step down.
Hörður and Ásgeir nevertheless saw reason to expound on the matter in Fréttablaðið's Friday edition, using big words on shadow direction, illegal acts and the urgent need for legal amendments.
This was truly a molehill that was to be made into a mountain, even though the molehill in question was conditional as well as being quickly removed.
Finally, let's consider the subject itself, as it is an important one.
They say that the boards of pension funds are obliged to protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these provisions are further elaborated in the Articles of Association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Commerce, as I have noted.
Fortunately, he reconsidered and reversed this.
Time will tell whether that will be enough, when all is said and done, for pension fund investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members.
One of those infected did not observe return hygiene measures
His screening at the border produced negative results.
"But he is in Icelandic society and actually should have used that remedy," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, expert at the Directorate of Health's Disease Prevention Department and acting Chief Epidemiologist during the latter's summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form, where it is not required to record your identification number, and if the identification number is not recorded, you are not automatically summoned to be tested for the second time."
"When the identification number is not registered, you have to request the second test yourself.
"It is therefore clear that we have to provide more information on this while we find some way to make an automatic summoning system despite Icelanders not registering their identification number.
Fortunately, the man in question was not in contact with many people when he came to the country despite being defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being Icelandic.
There have not been more cases in a single day since early May, with these reports coming at the same time as Spain begins lifting one of Europe's strictest curfew restrictions.
Others who were quarantined have other connections to the man.
Photos from the tournament, showing people celebrating the success of their team in very close contact out on the field, also drew attention yesterday.
It reads: "NOTE: Parents are please asked to respect the rule of participants fetching their thing from the school themselves.
Tracing of that infection is also underway, and the infected individual is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine because of the infection.
Finally, the announcement reads: The Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of Police and the Directorate of Health remind everyone to be careful and follow individual disease prevention measures carefully.
If there is the slightest chance of Covid-19 symptoms being present, the individual in question is asked to undergo testing at the nearest healthcare centre.
Vesturbyggð names Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes at Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalundur and Hótel Breiðavík as other potential choices.
Judging from the campsite demand, good attendance can be expected this year if the weather doesn't spoil things, with DV reporting earlier today that the forecast is awful.
However, the worst weather is expected to be to the south and there is hope for the residents of Patreksfjörður.
A whole apartment building rotting away in the best part of town
Meanwhile, the owners want a construction licence to make renovations, but their request has been stuck in the system for more than two years.
It was built in 1959 and former activities there include a video rental shop, shoemaker, milk shop, gunsmith, fishmonger and, most recently, University Printing.
The house has seen better days, to put it mildly.
Magnús was at the forefront of Borgun's group of owners and was the spokesman for the holding company Borgun.
The fact that the owners have, for several years, sought to alter the building and the lot may play a part in this.
He also says that he is ticked off at the owners of the building for not having made the effort to complete this thing, to find some common ground with the neighbours of the building and stop this "legal back-and-forth".
The "legal back-and-forth" that the neighbour refers to is the planning process for the lot, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
That was when the owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 sought permission to add a storey to the current apartment building and build, behind the building, a new elevator shaft and single-storey annex, as well as a basement.
The construction licence issued for this project was appealed to the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, which cancelled the licence as the construction project did not have a basis in the land use plan and the hearing notification procedure was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavik then commenced land-use planning work, which concluded with a notice in the Government Gazette in July of last year.
That plan was also appealed and the Commission invalidated it in March of 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed from the original application for a construction licence, and the owners of the building were back on square one.
Then there were those who said that the parking spaces were a cause of contention, as neighbours have used the unused parking spaces at Dunhagi 18-20 for their own vehicles.
A testament to cumbersome city administration and the noble intentions of the owners and their many years of work, which is now back on square one.
This reporter was met with wide open doors and piles of garbage upon arrival at Dunhagi 18.
A Playstation console and a newish television lay surrounded by other waste on the floor — victims of Icelandic summer precipitation.
The doors to the old University Print office was open and there was quite a lot of cats there, judging from the smell of urine.
Someone has obviously made a spot for themselves in one of the corners, but no one can be seen.
There were stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of pages on geology, which were undoubtedly intended to become a book.
They were Romanians who were boiling a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist to step inside.
The operations of temporary agencies have not been unaffected by the Covid-19 situation, as the recession in tourism has resulted in a recession in the construction industry, and these two industries have been among the ones that have made the most use of the services of temporary agencies.
When the journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he became suddenly aware of the irony: In a prime spot in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square metre property in disrepair.
Caught in between is the City's planning department, back on square one, the victim of endless means of appeals and complaints in the planning process and the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources' sluggishness in providing a solution.
Campaign against obesity following the coronavirus pandemic
The plan is for Johnson to launch the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday. As part of the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their overweight patients and efforts will be made to increase the number of cycling paths.
Johnson himself has had weight problems. He was admitted to an intensive care unit when he caught the coronavirus last spring, and the severity of his illness is believed to be partly due to his weight.
For being united and leading changes together.
"We are basing this on these female-centric values.
On the basis of human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and us actually all being in the same boat," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
It's ridiculous, we can divide things differently," said Helga.
On top of that, the driver's driving licence had previously been legally removed.
The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police had plenty to do last night, with more than 80 cases recorded in the Police Diary from five o'clock yesterday to five o'clock this morning.
Eleven loud parties were reported on the night before Saturday, which was considered a lot in the Police Diary.
Police also stopped the the driver of a vehicle towing a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan's running gear was, according to the Police Diary, in "very poor condition" so the caravan was detained.
According to the Airbnb site, the house will be next available in a week, on the Sunday of the Bank Holiday Weekend, so it might be ideal for any tradesmen on holiday to book the painter's house.
"A sequence analysis of the first domestic infection has been carried out and that was a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it was undetected in the community for any length of time.
Tracing of the infections has mostly been completed but it is not impossible that more will have to be quarantined.
"If more people are not isolated as a result of being in contact with these individuals at these sports tournaments, we could argue that our disease prevention measures at the tournaments were effective.
The Department of Civil Protection's procedures are constantly being reexamined, she says.
In just over a week, crowd restrictions will be eased to allow one thousand people.
This new situation could have an effect on the easing of restrictions.
She needs plenty of energy for her day-to-day life and she usually gives herself time to cook good, healthy food.
"I find that there is a kind of meditation in standing and cooking in the kitchen so I try to do it often.
Then I top the meal off with what I have at each time.
Usually it's a banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
Between meals: It varies incredibly, but fruits or vegetables, rye flatbread, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon straight from the box if necessary.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of rich salads from what's in the refrigerator; quinoa or barley, falafel, rocket and oven-baked vegetables with a tasty dressing are some of the things I'm working with.
If the schedule becomes completely unravelled (which happens frequently), the egg boiler at work has quite often saved me, and then it's 2 pieces of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, and Bob's your uncle.
Between meals: I'll get something rich in carbohydrates before practice, bread with toppings, breakfast cereal or fruits.
The online voting on the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's collective wage agreement on behalf of Icelandair airline hostesses will conclude at noon tomorrow.
"No dismissals have been reversed. This must become clear soon so the aeroplanes can be manned.
On 17 July, the board and council of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association decided to suspend all work at Icelandair and the decision was approved in a vote by the members.
This was never done, but the decision was made following Icelandair's decision to suspend negotiations with the Cabin Crew Association, dismiss all its airline hostesses and seek to negotiate with another trade union.
If it is rejected, the airline hostesses obviously feel that this was a step too far."
By then, Icelandair had dismissed all of the company's airline hostesses and flight attendants but withdrew the dismissals when the new collective wage agreement was signed.
Last Wednesday, Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Nasdaq Iceland, stating that the company's revenue during the quarter amounted to approximately USD 60 million, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
When asked what this means and whether this could indicate anything about a new wave of the pandemic having begun, Már says that this is an isolated incident at the moment and it was possible that nothing more would come of it.
"However, if there are more domestic cases with no overseas connections and the same genotype as this particular strain, the conclusion could be made [about a second wave] but it is not timely at this point," Már explains.
BBC presenters suggest this in a fun video that sheds light on the swimming pool and hot tub culture of Icelanders.
Freed from their mobile phones, people can have personal conversations on any subject or enjoy the healing virtues of the water by meditating and recharging their mental and physical batteries.
An uphill battle with one hundred days until the elections
Trump himself has attempted to shift the focus away from his response to the pandemic and onto Biden, promote the so-called culture gap and announce policies intended to revolve around law and order.
Trump's unpopularity also seems likely to have a negative effect on Republican senators, and prominent Republicans fear that Democrats might even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has been considered highly unlikely until now.
He also encouraged "housewives" in American suburbs to read an article by a former New York lieutenant governor who claimed that Biden would destroy American suburbs, which Trump agreed with.
When the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars had disrupted until then, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic through which the world is now jointly navigating.
Elite athletes have one more year to prepare themselves and Japanese authorities take on extra costs because of the postponement.
But all keep their chin up, as there is much at stake.
No expense is spared, the spectacle is always supposed to be dazzling and top the previous games.
The more spectacular the presentation — the more likely it is to be awarded.
In the second instance, in the application for the 2020 games, USD 75 million, about ISK 10 billion, was spent on the promotion.
For some elite athletes, postponing the games is an accidental blessing.
One of these is Australian pentathlon competitor and gold medallist at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, who is heavily pregnant and would have been absent this summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.
For the athletes who intended to retire after this year's games, had they been held at the right time, the postponement of the games means, in some instances, that they will retire from competition before the games are held.
They simply do not trust their body to withstand another year of hard training.
Few athletes were as successful in securing their place in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as the gymnastics star Simone Biles.
Although that is generally not considered old, it is rather much for a top-flight gymnast.
Obviously, we don't know for sure how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we can't do anything but train as if they will take place.
She, like others, has some doubts, or perhaps rather awareness of the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 either.
