These days, Trump is dealing with the corona virus epidemic, which his countrymen are increasingly blaming him for, and the vast majority of respondents say that the federal government reacted badly, or very badly, at the beginning of the epidemic.
Pictures of federal law enforcement officers yanking protesters into unmarked cars haven't helped America's cause either.

On July 17, Icelandair decided to fire all the 38 flight attendants who were working for the company at the time, while the wage dispute at the Flight Attendant Association was still on the table of the government conciliator.
There were divided opinions as to whether Icelandair could resort to these dismissals, and it was expected that the matter would be resolved before the Social Court.
However, it never came to that, as the flight attendants and Icelandair reconciled a little over 24 hours after the dismissals.

Prepares further transfers of public institutions abroad
The Fire Protection Department of the Housing and Civil Engineering Agency will be moved north to Sauðárkrók this fall by the minister's decision, but experts within the department have previously stated that they do not intend to move the farm north.
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said in Sprengisandi á Bylgjuni this morning that it is important for the countryside that public institutions are moved there.
Business development, currency-generating development, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some nature exploitation, and these types of jobs as public jobs are very supportive of that development," says Ásmundur.

If the virus spreads freely in the community, it will be very difficult to reopen in that state," Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."
Among other things, the guidelines call for distance between people to be guaranteed in schools, students and staff to be advised to use face masks and for students to be divided into defined groups to reduce the number of transmission routes.
If between 5 and 10% of analyzes return a positive result, "the matter starts to get complicated," but above 10% is "the threshold when it is necessary to carefully consider whether to close the school districts."
"It's a sign that the epidemic has gained a foothold in the community," Gottlieb said, adding that it would make it difficult for parts of Florida, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, to reopen schools next month.
Corona virus infections have increased in more than 30 states and the District of Columbia, but the center of the epidemic is currently in the so-called sun belt on the south coast of the United States.
Gottlieb said he expected more companies to introduce mandatory masks, especially as the risk is perceived to be high.
Crystal Palace fans were dealt a blow before the summer when Roy Hodgson, the club's manager, announced that striker Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the club.
Now 27 years old, it remains to be seen whether teams of his caliber are still willing to pay big sums for him, especially in the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a season in which Zaha scored four goals and made five assists for a somewhat disappointing Palace side.
Zaha found the back of the net just once from mid-December to the end of the season with a long-range shot in a defeat to Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale last summer when he tried to break away from the club, but no offer came in to tempt Palace into selling.
Zaha changed agents in January, apparently to increase his chances of leaving the club, and in the coming weeks his priority will no doubt be to secure a move.
Zaha is the player who played the most minutes in the Premier League for Palace this season and was the only player under the age of 28 to play 1100 minutes or more, showing how much of a squad rebuild could be necessary with the money available the player.
Hanna was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be on their toes: "It's not nearly over yet." We still expect catastrophic floods."
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has been hit hardest by COVID-19,” said Greg.
The hurricane first made landfall at 5 p.m. Saturday, 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.

Hayskapu on a blustery cruise in the South
Most have finished their first mowing, the second mowing has already started in many places, and it is expected that some will achieve a third mowing at the end of the summer.
The weather has played with southern farmers like other residents of the region this summer and the spring has not spoiled the farmers' fields.
Heyskapur has therefore gone well.
Sigurður says that it is growing, not least among cow farmers that they hay in flat pits or outdoor stands, which has worked out very well, but there is by far the most to be done in rolling haymaking.
"It's lively, yes, yes, it's actually been very comfortable for the last six months or three weeks, it's been so dry and nice and it's so comfortable to deal with.
But does Sigurður think that some farmers will strike three times?
"Yes, I could quite believe that, those who were first.
We started on June 17, it could be that those who were first have to take something three times."
His opponents have tended to grab him to make sure he doesn't get past them.
England's Prince Harry news: Duke of Sussex's friend disputes controversial claims in new book
Stott told Sky News that the content of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was in no way different from the content of the gossip magazines, the only difference being that the book was bound.
"There's a storyteller there who tells the story, but it's still not certain that it came from them."
"They are extremely popular."

Turkey pigeon, rosy starling, ring dove, white-nosed, grebe, and mourning dove are among the birds that have flocked to this country this summer.
On the Suðausturland Bird Observatory's website fuglar.is, you can almost daily see short news about the vagrants, where they have been seen and sometimes their gender.
He speaks beautifully about these animals that enrich Iceland's biosphere and play an important role there, and it doesn't matter if the bird is a large, large raptor or a small sparrow.
Hálfdán and his siblings at Kvískerjar attracted the interest of many who met them in Icelandic nature.
The networks are up every day, at least from around six in the morning until noon.
And they have to be visited every hour.
"Yes, we share this, me and Bjössi.
Between guarding the nets and during the periods when they are not up, Brynjúlfur and Björn are marking herons, skimmers and various moorhens where they can reach them.
"The forest tick jumps on the birds in their winter quarters and then gets a ride with them to this country in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, which is why these ticks are not large when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
Asked how the birds in the Southeast are faring this summer, Brynjúlfur says that the heron's nesting seems to be going well - as she nests everywhere.
"The heron's main nest here is at Hala in Suðursveit, and everything is going well there.
But on the other hand, there is no nest to be found anymore at Jökulsárlón, where a few years ago there was a huge nest."
He says that a few years ago over a thousand pairs of cranes hatched there, but now you can count them on the fingers of one hand.
"When we look at waders and waders, I think it has decreased in recent years what you find of them.
According to Brynjólf, what can explain the big change is most likely about the availability of food.
"It's all about food, after all."
Human actions can also have something to say about the survival of birds and other animals.
"One of the things that I think is positive is that the number of cows is increasing again after a great depression," says Brynjúlfur, "but meanwhile the skim has deteriorated drastically in the last few years and decades."
As for sparrows, the news is that it seems that the ladybird is going to do well in her nesting this summer, just like last year.
But let's turn to the vagabonds.
Often they attract a lot of attention, especially if they are very overlooked and even colorful.
These two interesting episodes are about one of the summer's most popular vagrants: the Rose Starling.
"Otherwise, it has been relatively quiet this summer in the vagrants," says Brynjúlfur, but mentions that in the countryside you can now find whooping cranes and ring doves have been seen and have started nesting here.
When Brynjúlfur and Björn come across strays, they mark them too, just like other birds.
Markings are international and they are practiced all over the world.
You can find out a lot of things with the markings, for example, where the birds' wintering grounds are, where they nest and what their migration routes are.
One heron from us was later found in the United States."
Brynjúlfi is particularly fond of one bird, and that is the skimmer.
"The skúrin is our bird," he says, pointing out that the Bird Observatory and the South-Eastern Nature Observatory have the task of monitoring its performance - which has become quite weak and now it is on the selection list.
It is difficult to say what caused the collapse of the population, but one theory is that the scum has taken advantage of seafood that used to be thrown from fishing boats and into the sea for good, but that it is now being used much better and this has an effect on the scum.
"Of course you can't get me to say no," Brynjúlfur says with a laugh and adds: "Since we're now also chasing stray birds, we must go further afield."
"This area is like a funnel into the country from Europe, but then the birds spread from here.
"The buzzard is my bird, as I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the country," he finally answers.
"I now enjoy taking pictures of barn owls the most.
The Crown Prince says that it is not up for discussion that women can skip covering their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot there when the sun is high in the sky and there is no you can rely on wind cooling.
But then one can wonder if it doesn't also reduce the interest of prospective tourists if they can't buy alcohol.

Bale did not feature in any of the team's last seven games and played little part in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebrations, and this summer the stalemate is that the player intends to stay put and let his contract expire, but the club hope he disappears.
"There is no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable for everyone," Kroos said on the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport podcast.
"He was not bought to play him as little as is the case now.
I think that he actually wanted to leave the club last summer and that the club actually said 'yes' but later said 'no'.

Anti-hunger organizations push Yoho aside after an incident in the parliament building

He said he regretted showing a "hasty attitude".
Just over seven minutes into normal time, Lingard deflected the ball from Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and scored into an empty net.
Those who have set foot on land have also been extremely lucky with the weather, and DV's weather experts agree that the summer has been nothing short of spectacular, so far at least.
But now it's time for the shopping weekend, which has so far been the biggest travel weekend of the year.
Suffice it to mention a national holiday as an example.
Knái meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in his forecast on his weather website, Blika, that a depression is to be expected during the shopping weekend.
He says: A low draft in the upper air with the accompanying cold that too often also reaches the surface, leads to the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, only a depression is formed with wind and precipitation.
As it approaches, it manages to 'bloom' in the form of decreasing air pressure and a perceived summer low."
The large forecast model, the European Compute Center on the left of the map, and the US GFS forecast on the right are fairly contemporary with this trend.
The return of the depression goes according to the forecast for late Thursday and early Friday with strong A-direction and rain in most of the country.
The center of the depression around 985 hPa then follows.
However, it could blow it along.
A man was seriously injured when a vehicle carrying cattle overturned in Wexford
A cattle truck veered onto the bridge and overturned onto an unoccupied parked car.
The technical department of the police is investigating the scene and the bridge has been closed and detours have been established.
"I was shot in her like you get a shot from childhood," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the lead actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age when many people begin to develop violent passions, she did not experience it like her peers because she strictly suppressed her own feelings.
She says that it is sometimes said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late period.
“We spend our teenage years repressing these adolescent urges, these shots and such.
It hit the actress when she was in New York a few years ago.
It comes out one day that Birna is a big fan of Mariska.
When the shooting of the film is finally finished, the group toasts and Birna tries one last time to convince the woman to try to get the meeting going.
"I look at the phone and scream at the top of my lungs.
"I don't know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck," reads the message, and Birna quickly gets dressed. She asks the reception where the filming takes place and takes the elevator up to the 45th floor, where the group is gathered.
Birna settles down and waits until a woman from the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
The actors regularly appear when there is a break in filming, they have a snack and Birna looks around for Mariska who is nowhere to be seen.
Birna asks him to get her hands on another employee, as it didn't occur to her to go anywhere right away.
Surprised, the friend agrees and reaches out to another employee.
"He says: Quick."
She takes the most direct route in a car with them so you have to take a chance and go down and find her caravan.
"Then I look to the right and lose my face" Birna rushes off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
However, she can't find Mariska's caravan, and then despair sets in.
Vondauf takes Birna back towards the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera crew looking at her with pitying eyes, as it is clear that Birna did not succeed in her mission.
Then I look to the right and lose my face."
None other than Mariska Hargitay was standing there in the pantsuit she wears in the shows, and Birna knew her very well - but Birna could hardly move because of her excitement.
Birna does so and manages to tap the actress on the shoulder.
The conversation did not go much further because Mariska's car has arrived and the whistle is blown at her.
Bear says goodbye to the idol, watches the car drive away, then breaks down.
"I frantically called Erling and Gunna and they thought it had not been successful.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
Then we drank mineral water and tequila," says Birna.
This is what a police sergeant in the traffic department of the police in the capital area says in an interview with mbl.is.
Tips have been received by mbl.is from people who are concerned that the same mouth piece is used for all drivers when the police arrive, stand on a thoroughfare and let everyone passing by blow.
The police say that the utmost cleanliness is maintained.
"There aren't really special mouthpieces, but we have a meter with a cup that people blow into," says a police officer.
If the sample is positive, the police use another measure.

In her ruling Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee overturned the expected deadline, saying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not have to release children if they cannot do so through one of the three ways outlined in her earlier order .
However, Gee also emphasized in his order that Immigration and Customs Enforcement still has an obligation to release the children without undue delay.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in Detention, said in June that where "masking and social distancing rules were not or were not followed" it was imperative to remove children from these facilities.
969 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have tested positive for the coronavirus and are in isolation or surveillance as of July 23, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

"Unbearable traffic jams at Ölfusárbrú," says the president of Árborg's town council
Helgi says that the municipal authorities in Árborg recently had a meeting with the director of Vegagerðin and the designer of Vegagerðin and that meeting was very positive.
"If you've ever been optimistic that work is being done on these issues, I think I can say that now because they are really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be tendered in autumn."
"Yes, it is possible to go through the congestion and through Eyrarbakki, it speeds up, but those who are going east, it is not possible to tell them to go to Lyngdalsheiði, but those who are going to the uplands should use Mosfellsheiði , Þingvelli and Lyngdalsheiði".
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of Árborg's town council, who says the traffic jams that occur at the Ölfusárbrú near Selfoss are intolerable.
The future of koala bears in Brisbane's north is headed for a planning hearing
City officials said the area, in addition to being a vital home for koalas, squirrels and the gray goshawk, is an important link between the Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek natural areas.
The developers argue that even though the proposal is fully in line with the plan, it could be amended if it does not meet the requirements, rather than rejected.
Brisbane City Council's minority leader said the city needed to buy the land to protect the koalas.
Schrinner said koala range mapping was a joint responsibility of the city council and the government, but the government was responsible for accurate koala range maps that local authorities rely on when considering development applications.

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed concern over Kiev's call for a review of the Minsk agreement, saying that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskiy's position on the "immutability of the Minsk agreement, which he reiterated in this call, should be reflected in actual action”.

Goal soup in Blika's first win in July
Skagamen, on the other hand, lose their third game in a row in the league.
It was do or die for Blika, who came into the game with great energy.
Skagamen could neither land nor beach in the first half, as the home team's high pressure made it extremely difficult for them to connect passes.
Blikar had all the power on the field and scored the third goal in the 36th minute when Dane Thomas Mikkelsen headed in Höskuldar Gunnlaugsson's corner kick.
Skagamen got a glimmer of hope for the second one when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty shortly before the break, but Kwame Quee had clumsily fouled Viktor Jónsson inside Blika's box.
The score was 4-1 for Breiðablik when the half-time whistle blew.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was then alone and powerless in Blika's goal area and easily headed the ball into the net after Tryggva Hrafn Haraldsson's corner kick.
However, Hlynur was fouled inside the ÍA box just three minutes later when he fouled Alexander Helga.
Breiðablik thereby won their first victory in almost a month, since June 29, and after the victory the team is in third place with 14 points, two points from Val, which is one place higher, and three from the top team KR.
However, KR and Valur both have a game inside Blika.
ÍA has to accept the third loss in a row in the league, but the team has ten points in eighth place, five points from relegation.
The puppy squad is not in danger despite the White House's comments
The producers of Hvolpasveitain confirmed yesterday that there is no reason to stop showing children's material in the near future.
However, the puppy band is not among them, despite the fact that there have been rumors to that effect on social media.
"We saw a few weeks ago that the performances of Hvolpasveitinn, a children's program about cops, were stopped.
Same with Cops and Live PD," McEnany said Friday.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and mistrust in relation to whether the other person is looking around, is thinking about cheating or even divorce and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to grow our relationship, but this is the kind of bruise that always hangs over us.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about this in your own corner, couldn't discuss it and even took some steps that you might later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always the best?
The reason that relationships that begin in adolescence do not always last a lifetime is often that people develop in different directions, but in cases where there is a synergy, the individuals can become a stronger whole than many others.
What does this many years of exclusivity give us?
I dare say that the advantages can be quite a lot more than the disadvantages.
But this doesn't just come with pink clouds and happiness, no, at your age it can become a messy task, which may never turn out as well as you have already done for each other.
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.

Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's lawyer in 'Wagatha Christie' romp with Rebekah Vardy
After negotiations between the spouses of the footballers went awry, their acquaintances expect a dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired Johnny Depp's famous defamation star lawyer to defend her in her so-called "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday reports that Rooney has instructed David Sherborne to defend herself against allegations that she defamed Vardy, with claims that personal details were leaked to the media from her closed Instagram account.
The paper states that the 38-year-old mother of five "suffered severe panic attacks and panic attacks so she was afraid to leave the house" and that Vardy, who was seven months pregnant at the time, "was laid up three times hospitalized ... due to anxiety attacks attributable to the post and its aftermath”.
After settlement talks between the two soccer wives failed, those in the know are expecting a dramatic showdown in the courtroom.
"If you thought the Depp trial was a spectacle, don't underestimate the upcoming soccer wives war," a source said.
In legal documents Vardy, who denies involvement, claims she was made a scapegoat after Rooney published the allegations "in a premeditated manner, with the aim of causing great harm and immense suffering".
A source said: "Becky's documents are a distraction, it's all made up."
And polls suggest that states that used to be solid Republican strongholds, such as Texas and Georgia, are now split between Trump and the former vice president.
The chairman of Geðhjálfar believes that he draws his creativity from his mental breakdowns, but a psychiatrist says that it is important that people take medication to keep the disease under control.
Later, some strange tweets from him appeared on Twitter, where he claimed, among other things, that his wife was trying to get him hospitalized.
And he is so wildly creative, wildly powerful and clearly in his powerful relational thinking, because you become aware of this relational thinking that we who have had the chance to go into a manic state know so well."
He has dealt with the psychosis, among other things on the album Ye.
"A lot of people think it stifles that creative element of this unfettered connection thinking and the wild creativity of the fire that it has, but then of course the downsides are often a lot of suffering, and valleys of waves and dark cellars and darkness."

Delhi Metro lays the first pillar of the fourth phase of construction
Delhi Metro achieved a major milestone in the fourth phase of construction with the laying of the first pillar for the under construction route between Janakpuri West and RK Ashram Marg, officials said on Sunday.
The pillar was cast in Keshopur and on an elevated section between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday evening.
However, the bollards will be 20 meters high at Madhuban Chowk, where the route overlaps Route 1, and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route meets Route 2.
The highest point of the train system is currently at Dhaula Kuan, where the Route 7 bridge road reaches a height of 23.6 meters.
In the context of civil engineering, piers are vertical load-bearing structures that support the adjacent ends of two tracks.
They form the vertical structures that support the elevated bridge roads of the train system.
These rail system pillars can be seen on the innumerable highways that run under the Delhi rail system tracks.
The numbers of the pillars now play an important role as landmarks for addresses in the Delhi metropolitan area.
On June 24, DMRC started pouring U-beams that would later be installed in the elevated section of the route.
The number reached 1 million last Friday.
The percentage of patients who have been diagnosed with the corona virus is 11%.
India, the third worst affected country by the coronavirus outbreak after the United States and Brazil, has gradually increased its screening capacity for COVID-19, conducting more than 420,000 tests in a single day, the health ministry said on Saturday, which says this achievement is explained by the increase in the number of laboratories.
'Sick' Ambassador Wants Gun, Armored Car and Stab Vest - Said Underlings Are 'Deep State' Ambassadors
He is also said to have requested an armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and a stabbing vest.
However, bodyguards had been advertised in Icelandic newspapers, says CBS, and that is part of meeting the ambassador's demands.
Since Gunter took over in May, he is said to have created an "impossible" work environment in the embassy and he has already had seven subordinates, the so-called Deputy Chief of Mission, subordinates of the ambassador who are also seconded diplomats.
As a result, a rotation of staff was created and the idea was to let Gunter fit as many as possible until he saw one of them.
Furthermore, CBS reports that Gunter expected embassy staff to do the work of the "deep state" and to have undermined him vis-à-vis the State Department in Washington DC
The ambassador to South Africa has also come under fire for firing his number two man and then trying to appoint her son to the job.
Repeated explosions echoed through the streets of Seattle, Washington, and smoke billowed from the site where protesters had set fire to trailers at a construction site near a juvenile detention center.

Airstrikes conducted by the air wing of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp of a militant group led by the so-called "Dangote" in Doumborou Forest in Zamfara State.
Lt. Gen. John Enenche, a defense spokesman, said the airstrike, which also killed a number of militants, was carried out following HUMINT data collection and a series of air patrols for confirmation.
Lt Gen Enenche said the intelligence revealed that the squad members had moved with supplies, motorbikes and hundreds of stolen cash from their previous residence to the new location through a rocky mountainous terrain inside the forest.
Enenche said the air force had subsequently deployed a special force of fighter jets and armed helicopters from the Nigerian Army to attack the area.
He is quoted as saying: "The attack aircraft fired accurate shots at the area and killed some of the militants.
Many others, who are seen trying to flee the area in the chaos, were killed in further attacks."
While commending the Operation HADARIN DAJI squadron for their professionalism, the Air Force Chief of Staff, Air Police Officer Sadique Abubakar, urged the squadron not to relent in airstrikes against militants.

President Aleksandar Vucic said "certain inquiries" were underway to buy a fleet of fighter jets, and accused the United States and other Western powers of arming Serbia's NATO neighbors, as well as Kosovo, a former Serbian province.

In the West and in Serbia's neighboring countries, people are worried about the Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia.
It was Cloes that paved the way for collection campaigns such as Australia's Little Shop, the first of which in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the supermarket's best-ever quarterly sales.
However, the new fundraising campaign may have less of an impact this time around, with UBS analysts forecasting higher sales at Australian supermarkets for most of the 2021 financial year.

The last trip there is possibly my favorite trip of the year, but then 25 of us went together in 5 big cars up to Fljótshlíð and from there to Álftvatn.
Otherwise, I will be in the highlands a lot in the near future, as it is not possible to explore that area all year round."

There were already factions in the parliament. The corona virus could make them worse.
The study examines familiar themes related to the deplorable state of Congress: the lack of real relationships between parties, an agenda that limits opportunities for communication, too much concentration of power in leadership positions, constant demands for fundraising, reports of cross-party cooperation, the negative influence of the media as are operating 24/7, the fact that the most important elections for MPs are often primaries and finally the silencing of minority parties.
There are also warnings that Congress moving more online due to the pandemic could exacerbate existing problems.
The call for civility was particularly relevant this week, when Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Florida, attacked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, and his fellow Republicans joined forces to attack Rep. Liz Cheney, Rep. Wyoming with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings Talks Vice Presidency, Lets Trump Hear It For Pardons
Demings was one of four House prosecutors in the Senate trial of Donald Trump in January.
Regardless of whether the Senate acquits Trump, he will make history as the fourth president to be impeached.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she opposes Trump's pardoning of Rogers Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other crimes) as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes, saying, "The shamelessness to pardon your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your wrongdoings”.
She then put her hand to her mouth while laughing and pretending to whisper to those watching the live broadcast, adding "If you guys want to call ... you can for me."
This did not go unnoticed by Demings.
Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's comments that Trump could refuse to leave the White House if he loses the election, and another editorial saying the president is preparing to pardon himself, Demings came to life: "That so much that suggests pardoning himself made me sick".

New York City Fire Department official says it's 'absolutely' fine to exclude white firefighter from honor guard
A representative for diversity at the New York City Fire Department says it's "absolutely" fine to keep a white firefighter from the honor guard so flag bearers can be all black, according to a new report.
According to McWilliams' complaint, the fire department's operations department had selected him to be one of the flag bearers in the honor guard at the memorial service.
When he attended the ceremony, however, he was barred from joining the guard of honor by the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, because she had allegedly requested that all flag bearers at the mass be black.
Among the things she is said to have asked him to do is escort civilians and line up uniformed firefighters away from the mass.
When Loving, who is black, testified in court, McWilliams' attorney, Keith Sullivan, asked her: "So asking everyone to be black in the honor guard isn't discrimination?"
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to request that everyone wear a black sword of honor, to which she replied, "Absolutely."
In an excerpt, Sullivan wrote that excluding McWilliams from the honor guard at the Mass was "tragic" and a sign that one thing did not apply to everyone in the fire department.
"The New York City Fire Department has created a policy and process designed to appease, condone, and sympathize with racist Vulcan members ... and this needs to stop," Sullivan also wrote.
The knife was confiscated and a report taken from the person.
Roughly eighty cases came to the police's table in the capital area from 5 pm to 5 am, and this morning six were kept in a prison cell.
Among other things, the police stopped the driver of a car pulling a caravan in Kjalarnes, where the caravan's wheels were in a very bad condition.
The caravan was immobilized and its owner planned to provide transport to take it to town.
They had already escaped from the scene when the police arrived "probably knowing the shame as it is still quite a long way until the end of the year."
Degtaryev has let those calls rush through his ears like wind.
Yesterday's protestors were slightly fewer than in the first protest, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the release of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia.
However, the same political commentators tell the BBC that Furgal's victory in the mayoral elections two years ago - which was overwhelming and unquestionable - was a considerable blow to Putin and United Russia, and although it indicated that the Kremlin's grip on the eastern regions was weakening.
Homeless women with disabilities join the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Her work has even led to the diagnosis and treatment of infection in time in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of the 16,000 Chennai city workers who carry out home screenings and are not health workers.
However, this is nothing to worry about.
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay at the city's shelter for women with disabilities and join the fight against Covid-19.
Although Kavitha has a specially equipped bicycle, she goes to meet people on foot and holds her crutches.
"I'm happy," she says about the reduction in infections, but adds: "I want to see them go down to maybe 100 a day."
On the first floor of the hostel where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball player who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, upload all the data received from about 40 women to the Chennai city's web server.
A few months ago, when the corona virus first reached Chennai, these disabled women devoted their time and skills to sewing masks for the city's health workers.
