Police are trying to track down a teenager in Helensburgh
In recent weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in relation to racial inequality in sports in South Africa.
Ashwell Prince, the former Proteas cricket star, let his white former teammates hear it and accused them of racism by calling him and other black team members "quota players".
He added that it was sad that even when black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada achieved top records in the sport, some people still associated them with the quota debate.

Conservative Party MPs were outraged when the public and general workers' union told its members to kick their feet when their bosses ordered them to return to their workplaces.
"It is unacceptable that people are refusing to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories across the country have continued to work so that public servants can eat during this," he said.
"Many of these workers now want to go on summer vacation but can't because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplaces, even though it's safe.

The CBS report says that Iceland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not provided information on whether a request has been received from the United States about Gunter's possible weapons, because the authorities do not comment on security measures for foreign diplomats.

'Bigger is better' is clearly the motto of the new owners of a massive property in the Lovely Banks neighbourhood, which just sold for A$1270.
"It was the way the property was put together, that it was three acres, and that it was in this location," Grgic said.
CBS' coverage also discusses the various problems that have plagued the American embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy ambassador seven times.
Thus, the first deputy ambassador is said to have prepared for his job for a long time and learned Icelandic only to be denied the position at the last minute because Gunter "didn't like him" at their first meeting.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland as a result, leaving his temporary deputy to do his job for months at a time, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
The CBS coverage also reports on Gunter's unpopularity in Iceland, especially in connection with a tweet in which he calls the corona virus the "invisible China virus", for which he has received a lot of criticism.

Russian fighter Khamzat Chimaev is now being touted as the UFC's next star after making history at Fight Island, but he says he has no intention of flaunting his wealth like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev outclassed Northern Iranian Rhys McKee in their welterweight bout in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, defeating his rival three minutes and nine seconds into the first round by sending him crashing to the floor.
The victory marked Chimaev's name in the UFC history books for the shortest time between victories in the competition's modern history, as only 10 days had passed since he defeated Briton John Phillips in a similar decisive manner, then at middleweight.
Chimaev, who is 8-0, earned a $50,000 bonus for tonight's performance against McKee, and has captured the MMA world's attention so thoroughly that he is now being dubbed "Khalib 2.0," a comparison that is arguably inevitable due to his sheer size. there are similarities between Chimaev's dominance and that of the UFC lightweight champion, and since he was born in Tetenia, which is close to Khabib's home country of Dagestan.
Despite his newfound fame and financial gains, the popular Chimaev has said he would not be keen to flaunt his wealth like MMA moneymaker Conor McGregor or his boxing counterpart Floyd Mayweather Jr.
Among others, he has attracted the attention of teammate Conor McGregor and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social network that he could "easily" beat Chimaev by submission.
There was no venomous response from the fighter who goes by the name 'Borz', or 'wolf' in his native Tetanian, who said he would 'grind Danis with his eyes closed'.
Chimaev, who now resides in Stockholm, Sweden after moving to the country at the age of 19, may not show much of his financial prowess, but he is clearly not shy about flaunting his fighting skills.
"I can grind anyone...
I can grind them all,” he said.
"Give me a 77kg champion (welterweight), 84kg champion (middleweight), I'll grind them both, same day."
The participants also moved onto the Alameda exit at Interstate 101 but later left it.
50 crowd limit in mosques on Eid and no Eidgah prayer gatherings, Karnataka govt says
The Karnataka government has announced that only 50 people can gather in mosques for Eid-ul-Azha prayers, and has banned prayer gatherings at Eidgahs and other places due to the coronavirus outbreak.
If more people attend than that, the prayer times should be split up, the ministry says in the directive.
Prayer gatherings cannot be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, community centers or 'Shadi Mahals', it said.
The Karnataka government is allowing temples, mosques and other places of worship to be open to those who wish to pray from June 8, provided proper precautions are taken against the spread of COVID-19.
The CBS television station covered the case on its website this morning, and according to sources in Washington, Gunter is paranoid, demanding to be allowed to carry a weapon himself, to be given a bulletproof vest and an armed escort as well as a bulletproof vehicle.

Increased weight in protests against racial inequality in the United States
Two people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with different types of the virus.
After sequencing by the Icelandic Genetics Institute, it was found that the two individuals who were diagnosed with the virus and are related have a new variant of it that has not been diagnosed before in this country.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of epidemiology at the National Health Service and deputy epidemiologist, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now examining where this type of virus is most likely to have come from.
"Yes, this is so different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that it was something brewing here," replies Kamilla.
"Rather, there is every possibility that these individuals have somehow come into contact with a person who has just arrived from somewhere outside, without knowing it themselves."
We will be on our toes for the next few days to monitor it."
Guess there's a community contagion going on right now?
It hasn't been recently, but it's not ruled out because we don't know who has transmitted this infection to these individuals, who were diagnosed on the one hand on Tuesday and on the other hand yesterday," she answers.
Thus, it can be expected that Landspítali's bacteriology and virology department will contribute to the sampling in the coming days in order to better map the situation here in the country.

Risi from Kristnapolli in Laxá in Däly
The first hundred buck was caught in Laxá in Dälum in the afternoon today.
He had spawned in Kristnapolli this morning and it was 89 centimeters.
In the afternoon, he had another chance at Kristnapolli, and he thought of a story he had heard about how the hag likes to take off after the spawn has been caught.
With this in mind, he took a Collie Dog and threw over Kristnapool.
Soon he got a shot and as he himself tells.

The Curse of the Glee Squad - The Terrible Fate of the Glee Stars
The theory has spread on the Internet that a curse rests on the series about the Glee Squad, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third main actor of the series to die far too early.

"I don't think there are many fishermen who work in preschools in the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who does beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.

"In coastal fishing, I'm never fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I've been continuously for one and a half days out at sea fishing. "
He says that the arrangement in coastal fishing is such that he can catch 770 kilos per day, which he finds inhibiting.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to row instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to make their own choices.
So the zoning could also go for me, and sea areas that are well located near the fishing should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from salty seas during his coastal fishing, but also only roach and occasional other species float along.
Axel works during the winter with the university program at the nursery school Núpi in Kópavogur.
An error in the registration prevented a homecoming sepsis
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on return home infection even though they filled out the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people for sampling again after they arrived in the country.

Bjartmar, the bike whisperer, has recovered a bike worth millions - now answers for himself after DV's coverage
Bjartmar has earned the name "bike whisperer" as a result.
DV then referred to discussions on the Vesturbæinga Facebook group where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man in Austurvelli and said the scooter was possibly stolen.
It was only possible to read from the electric shuttle man's original writings that Bjartmar had accused him of being a thief.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from a victim of an electric shuttle theft that it was indeed his electric shuttle.
"I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, having information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to leave on the shuttle, I decided to give it a shot and talk to the man.
In general, I'm very good at things like this, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word away."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
In the more than a year that Bjartmar has been practicing this practice, he says he can count the number of times he's run afoul of people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
"Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately, theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
There are examples of people who have gone to treatment and taken care of themselves and then come to me and help me with what I'm doing," he says.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started telling people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with DV's previous reporting and says that he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
When asked if he has not reached a slippery slope with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that it certainly is.
She is quite frankly powerless in these matters."
He says that he has been so successful in tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he comes across his "clients" on the street, and they just return the Bjartmari bikes that they had previously recovered.
Electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles weigh heavily there, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works at a condominium.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much greater and more permanent wage improvement than the increase in the number of ounces in the wage envelope, which disappeared just as hard in the heat of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until the 1990s, as many remember.
This is all reviewed here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not expected that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "the most accepted": Shadow management is when a leader in a union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the company to the board pension fund's recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position in a specific matter.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leader doesn't take this to the media and doesn't talk about dismissal, it's not "shadow management", because of course, this kind of communication between people always happens in the financial world, just like anywhere else.
I'll leave it up to the reader to decide which way they think is more "shady."
The reason for both arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the Reykjavík Business Association, then sent out that recommendation to the company's board members The shopkeepers' pension fund not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be dismissed.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to talk about the issue in the Fréttablaðinn's Friday issue with big words about shadow management, breaking the law and the great need for changes in the law.
There, a small tufa was indeed to overturn a heavy head, even though the blessed tufa had been in the mode of attachment and, moreover, had been quickly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the topic itself at the end.
They include that fund boards must protect the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of association of both Gildis and the shopkeepers' pension fund, as I mentioned.
Fortunately, he noticed and retracted it.
Time will tell if it is enough for the pension fund's investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members when it comes down to it.
One of the infected people did not use an antiseptic when they returned home
He tested negative at the border.
"But he is in Icelandic society and he should actually go to that resort," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, expert in the epidemiologist at the National Health Service and deputy epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the social security number, and if the social security number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
"When the social security number is not registered, you have to try to come to the second sampling yourself.
"So it is clear that we need to strengthen the provision of information about this while we find some way to make an automatic notification system even though Icelanders do not register their social security number.
Fortunately, the person in question had few contacts upon arrival in the country, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
No more people have been diagnosed there in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
Others who were sent to quarantine are related to the man in a different way.
However, pictures from yesterday's tournament attracted attention, where you could see a very close community celebrating the good performance of their team out on the field.
It says "NOTE: Parents, please respect the rules that contestants pick up their own stuff from school.
Work is being done on infection tracing in that case as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
Finally, the announcement states: The Public Safety Department of the National Police Commissioner and the Office of the National Medical Examiner urge people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual infection control.

Judging by the attendance at the campsite, a good turnout can be expected this year, if the weather doesn't put a damper on the calculation, but DV said earlier today about a far-fetched forecast.
However, the worst weather to the south can be expected, and hope for Patreksfjörður.
An entire apartment building decays in the best location in the city
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking a building permit for renovations, but their case has been stuck in the system for the third year.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, housed a video rental, Skóstofuna, Mjólkursamsalunn's dairy, Jóa gunsmith, a fishmonger and most recently Háskólprent.
The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its beauty.
Magnús led Borgun's ownership group and was the representative of Borgun's holding company.
It may play a role in the fact that the owners have been looking to change the house and the plot for several years.
He also says that he is mad at the building's owners for not hurrying to finish this, find some common ground with the building's neighbors and stop this "legal jam".
The "legal quagmire" the resident refers to is the plot's planning process, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor plus a basement.
The building permit that was granted for that project was appealed to the Environmental and Natural Resources Decision Committee, and the committee annulled it because the project was not supported by local planning and the neighborhood promotion was not adequate.
The City of Reykjavík then started with local planning work and finished it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That organization was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the building's owners were at the starting line.
Still others called the parking lots a problem, but neighbors have used the unused parking lots at Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
A monument to the slip rope of the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work, which is now at the starting line.
When a journalist was carried to a yard at Dunhaga 18, he was greeted by a gaping door and piles of trash.
A Playstation computer and a recent TV lay among other rubbish on the ground — victims of the Icelandic summer wetness.
The old office of Háskólprent was opened, and there were quite a few cats judging by the smell.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geology pages, which were no doubt meant to become a book, were scattered.
The Romanians were there cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
Temporary agency operations have not been spared by the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a recession in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most efficient in making use of temporary agency services.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavík, there is a dilapidated 1,500 square meter property.
In between, the city's planning department sits at the starting line, a victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process, and the fleeting decision of the Environmental and Natural Resources Decision Committee.

Top this meal off with what's available at any time.
Most of the time it's banana and crunchy muesli &amp; COFFEE.

Lunch: I often make all kinds of hearty salads from what's in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing are a bit of what I'm working with.

Intermediate: Have something high in carbohydrates before training, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.

Asked what it means and whether it could indicate that a second wave of the epidemic has started, Már says that at the moment it is a single case and it could end up being nothing more.
"But on the other hand, if there are domestic cases that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about a second wave], but it is premature at the moment," explains Már .

Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance in the face of the epidemic to Biden, fueling so-called cultural disputes and announcing policy issues that should be about law and order.

He then encouraged the "housewives" of America's suburbs to read an article by the former deputy governor of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy America's suburbs, and Trump agreed.

Few athletes captured the hearts of viewers at the 2016 Rio Olympics as thoroughly as gymnast Simone Biles.
