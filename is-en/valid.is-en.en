These days, Trump has to deal with a coronavirus pandemic for which more and more Americans blame him, with the vast majority of people polled saying that the federal government responded poorly or very poorly at the start of the pandemic.
Nor have photographs of federal agents pulling protesters into unmarked cars helped the cause of the United States.
The same can be said of Florida, according to polls from CNN and Quinnipiac University.

On 17 July, Icelandair decided to lay off all 38 airline hostesses employed by the company while the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's wage dispute was still under consideration by the State Conciliation and Mediation Officer.
There were differing opinions about whether Icelandair's layoffs were legal and the case was expected to be resolved before the Labour Court.
That never happened, though, as the airline hostesses and Icelandair reached an agreement just over 24 hours after the layoffs.
When you're negotiating and with the State Conciliation and Mediation Officer, this way should not be an option.
"Now you also see dangerous talk of how normal it would be to reorganise this system to reduce this right, and I'm completely against that."
Prepares to relocate more government agencies outside the capital area
The Fire Prevention Department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be relocated to Sauðárkrókur next autumn, according to the Minister's decision, but experts within the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move to the north of the country.
This morning, Minister of Social Affairs and Children Ásmundur Einar Daðason stated in an interview with Sprengisandur on Bylgjan that it was important for rural areas that government agencies move there.
Economic development, development that brings in currency, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry or some kind of utilisation of nature, and the nature of government jobs is such that they will provide great support for this development," says Ásmundur.
"More diversity and better support for the nation's resource utilisation and currency income will be created."
"I think it's completely clear that there are differing political opinions on how vigorously this should be pursued.
More relocations."
There have been repeated violent conflicts between police and protesters since the President deployed federal troops in unmarked cars there, against the wishes of local authorities.

If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop." Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."
The guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing, recommend students and staff wear face coverings, and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others, among other guidelines.
A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is "starting to get iffy," while above 10% is the "threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts."
"That is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community," Gottlieb said, adding that it's going to be difficult for parts of Florida, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., to open their schools for in-person learning next month.
More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.
Gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues, especially those considered high-risk.
Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson dealt a blow to fans ahead of the close-season by revealing star attacker Wilf Zaha wants to leave the club.
At age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him, particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport, after a campaign in which Zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a Palace side which failed to inspire.
Zaha himself netted just once between mid-December and the end of the season, a long-range strike in a defeat to Chelsea.
He was reported to have handed in a transfer request last summer in a bid to force a move away, but a bid didn't materialise to tempt Palace to sell.
In an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure, Zaha changed agents in January and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away.
Zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the Premier League this season for Palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1,100 minutes or more, pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the No 11.

Haymaking going very well in South Iceland
Most have cut their grass once, the second round has begun in many places and some are expected to be able to cut their grass for the third time in late summer.
The summer weather has been kind to South Iceland farmers, like other inhabitants of the region, and the growth of the grass in their fields does not make matters worse.
Haymaking has therefore gone well.
Sigurður says that more people, not least dairy farmers, have been using stacks or pits in haymaking with great success, although it's by far most common to use bales.
"It's lively, yes, yes. In fact, this has been very convenient for the past two or three weeks because the weather has been so nice and dry, making it easy to manage.
But does Sigurður think that any farmers will cut the grass a third time?
"Yes, that could very well be, those who were first.
We started on 17 June. It's very possible that those who were first may have to cut something three times."
His opponents have occasionally grabbed him to make sure that he didn't overtake them.

The Eurasian collared dove, common wood pigeon, two-barred crossbill, black-throated loon and common crane are some of the birds that have strayed to Iceland this summer.
Fuglar.is, the website of the South East Iceland Birds Observatory, has almost daily brief reports of such rare birds, where they were spotted and sometimes their sex.
He talks affectionately about these animals who enrich the Iceland fauna and have an important function, whether they be a big and powerful bird of prey or a tiny passerine bird.
Many of those who got to know Hálfdán and his siblings at Kvísker began to share their interest in Icelandic nature.
The nets are up all day, from at least six in the morning and into the afternoon.
And they have to be checked once every hour.
"Yes, we divide it between us, Bjössi and me.
Between their turns watching the nets and during the times when they are not up, Brynjólfur and Jón are tagging arctic terns, great skuas and various moorland birds wherever they can catch them.
"The castor bean ticks jump on the birds in their winter location and then hitch a ride with them when they come here in spring.
This happens shortly before they set off so the ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then they jump from the bird and try to find another host when they have to."
When asked how the birds of South-East Iceland are doing this summer, Brynjúlfur replies that the arctic tern's egg-laying seems to be going well — where it lays eggs at all.
"The arctic tern's main nesting grounds are at Hali in Suðursveit, and everything is going well there.
There are no nesting grounds at Jökulsárlón anymore, however, where there were huge nesting grounds several years ago."
He says that a few years ago, more than a thousand arctic tern pairs laid eggs there, but now they can be counted on one hand.
"When we look at moorland birds and shorebirds, it seems like you find fewer of them in the last few years.
Brynjúlfur thinks that this great shift is probably due to food supply.
"Everything revolves around food, of course."
He says that human activity could also have an effect on the survival of birds and other animals.
"One positive thing I've found is that the number of arctic skuas is increasing again after a great lull," says Brynjólfur, "but meanwhile, the great skua has suffered terrible decline in the last years and decades."
As for passerine birds, it seems like the white wagtail should do well in its egg-laying this summer, like it did last year.
But let's talk about the stray birds.
They often cause quite a bit of stir, particularly if they are very rare or perhaps colourful.
These two interesting factors apply to one of the summer's most popular strays: the common wood pigeon.
"But this summer has actually been relatively quiet when it comes to strays," says Brynjúlfur, but notes that a common crane can now be found in the area, and that common wood pigeons have been spotted and are beginning to nest here.
When Brynjúlfur and Björn come into contact with strays, they tag them just like other birds.
The tags are international and used all over the world.
Tagging can provide various information, e.g. about the birds' winter location, where they nest and their migration routes.
One of our arctic terns was later found in the United States."
One bird is particularly close to Brynjúlfur's heart: the great skua.
"The great skua is our bird," he says, pointing out that the South East Iceland Birds Observatory and the South East Iceland Nature Research Centre have the task of monitoring its survival status — which has become rather poor, placing it on the watch list.
It's hard to say with any certainty what caused the population drop but according to one theory, the great skua used to benefit from the catch thrown into the sea from fishing vessels, with a corresponding effect on the population now that the catch is utilised much more extensively.
"You obviously can't get me to say no," says Brynjólfur with a laugh, adding: "We're also chasing strays so we have to go to more places."
"This area is like a bottleneck where birds come into the country from Europe before dispersing.
„The pied avocet is my bird, as I've found nine of the ten spotted in Iceland," he answers at last.
"Photographing the common snipe may be the most fun.
The Crown Prince says that it's out of the question for women to avoid covering their shoulders and knees in public while admitting that it's not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in a country where it's too hot when the sun is high in the air and you can't rely on the wind chill.
But then it's also possible that the unability to buy alcohol might dampen the interest of potential tourists.
Francois Bozize, deposed CAR leader, announces presidential bid
Bale did not feature in any of the last seven games and was a peripheral figure in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebrations ahead of a summer stand-off as the player looks to stay and see out his contract and the club hope he will leave.
"There is no way to avoid the situation being unsatisfactory for everyone," Kroos told the Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport! podcast.
"They certainly didn't sign him to play as little as he is now.
"I think in principle he wanted to leave last summer and that the club said 'yes' in principle and then 'no' after that.

Travellers have also enjoyed exceptionally good weather, and DV's weather commentators all agree that the summer has been just splendid, at least up to this point.
But the Bank Holiday Weekend, which has traditionally been the biggest travel weekend of the year, draws closer.
The Westman Islands National Festival is just one example.
Famed meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in the forecast on his weather website, Blika, that a depression is expected on the Bank Holiday Weekend.
He says: Troughs in the upper atmosphere, with a corresponding cold that often extends down to the surface, cause a depression with wind and rain to form when the warmer air from the southwest attempts to enter.
When it approaches, it manages to "flower" in the form of dropping air pressure and a considerable summer depression."
The big forecast models, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts to the left on the map and the American GFS forecast to the right are pretty much in agreement on this development.
According to the forecast, the front of the depression will pass on late Thursday and early Friday with a strong wind from the east and rain in most of the country.
A 985 hPa centre of low will then follow.
However, there could also be wind along with this.
Man seriously hurt as cattle truck overturns in Wexford
A cattle truck lost control going over the bridge and, in the process, overturned onto an unoccupied parked car.

"I had a crush on her, one of those youthful crushes that you have," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, lead actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
When Birna herself was a teenager, at the age when many people begin to develop raging crushes, she did not have the same experience as her peers because she was busy suppressing her own feelings.
She says that people who come out of the closet are often said to experience delayed puberty.
"We spend our teenage years suppressing these teenage urges, these crushes and so on.
The actress got lucky when she was in New York a few years ago.
One day, the talk turned to how much of a fan of Mariska Birna is.
When the film shoot was finally over, the crew celebrated and Birna made a final attempt to convince the woman to try to arrange the meeting.
"I looked at the phone and screamed.
"I don't know when they start or when they stop but this is the name of the hotel, good luck," read the message. Birna got dressed in a hurry. She asked the reception were the shoot was taking place, and took the lift up to the 45th floor, where the group was gathered.
Birna found a spot and waited until a woman in the crew came to her and asked this woman who no one had invited, if she could help her with anything.
The actors came out regularly during breaks in shooting to have snacks, and Birna looked around in search of Mariska, who was nowhere to be seen.
Birna asked him to pass her on to another crew member, as she had no intention of going anywhere yet.
Surprised, the friend agreed and fetched another crew member.
"He said: Hurry.
She'll go directly to the car with them so you'll have to take the chance and go down to find her trailer.
"Then I looked to the right and was astounded" Birna rushed to take the lift down to Times Square.
She didn't find Mariska's trailer anywhere, however, and she began to feel desperate.
Feeling disheartened, Birna began walking back to the hotel, where she saw the crew look at her through the window with pity in their eyes, as it was clear that Birna had not succeeded at what she had set out to do.
Then I looked to the right and was astounded."
None other than Mariska Hargitay was standing there in the trouser suit that she wears on the show and Birna knows quite well — but Birna was so emotional that she could hardly move.
Birna did so, and gathered the courage to poke the actress's shoulder.
The conversation wasn't much longer, as Mariska's car had arrived and the horn honked for her.
Birna said goodbye to her idol, watched the car drive away and then collapsed.
"I was weeping when I called Erlingur and Gunni, and they thought that this hadn't worked.
But I was crying because of the release of pent-up tension and the joy.
Then we celebrated with club soda and tequila," says Birna.
This is according to a police officer in the traffic division of the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police, in an interview with mbl.is.
Mbl.is has received comments from people who are worried about the same mouthpiece being used for all drivers when the police positions itself on a busy traffic street and lets all who pass by blow into a breathalyser.
However, the police says that strict hygiene measures are observed.
"In fact, these are not special mouthpieces but breathalysers with a cup for people to blow into," the policeman says.
If the test turns out to be positive, the police uses another breathalyser.

In a Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order can't be met.
But Gee also underscored in her order that ICE still has a duty to release children in a timely manner.
Gee -- who oversees implementation of the Flores Agreement, which governs care of children in custody -- said in June that given "non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules," it was imperative to transfer children out of the facilities.
There are 969 detainees in ICE custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of July 23, according to ICE.

Future of north Brisbane koala habitat site goes to planning court
The council said as well as being critical koala, squirrel glider and grey goshawk habitat, it was a key link between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek bushland corridors.

A torrent of goals in Breiðablik's first win in July
Meanwhile, ÍA lost its third league match in a row.
So it was do or die for the Breiðablik team, which began the game with great energy.
ÍA couldn't catch a break in the first half, as the home teams' relentless pressure made it enormously difficult for them to connect passes.
Breiðablik ruled the pitch completely and added their third goal in the 36th minute when Danish player Thomas Mikkelsen scored a header following Höskuldur Gunnlaugsson's corner.
ÍA gained a sliver of hope before the second half when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty just before half-time, following Kwima Quee's clumsy foul on Viktor Jónsson in Breiðablik's penalty area.
This meant that Breiðablik lead by 4-1 at half-time.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was alone and unguarded in Breiðablik's goal area and guided Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson's corner effortlessly into the net.
However, Hlynur committed a foul in ÍA's penalty area only three minutes later, when he fouled Alexander Helgi.
With this, Breiðablik won its first match in almost a month, since 29 June. The victory puts the team in third place with 14 points, two points away from Valur in second place and three points away from KR in first place.
However, both KR and Valur have played one less match than Breiðablik.
ÍA must accept its third league loss in a row and now has ten points in eighth place, five points from being relegated.
Paw Patrol not at risk despite White House comments
The producers of Paw Patrol reaffirmed yesterday that there were no immediate plans to cancel the children's series.

Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's barrister for her Wagatha Christie battle with Rebekah Vardy
After talks between WAGs failed, insiders are expecting dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity barrister acting for Johnny Depp in his blockbuster libel case to represent her in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday understands that Mrs Rooney has instructed David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy with allegations that personal information was leaked from her private Instagram account to a newspaper.
The papers say the 38-year-old mother of five "suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety which manifested in being scared to leave the house," adding that Mrs Vardy, who was seven months pregnant at the time, "was taken to hospital three times... as she suffered anxiety attacks as a result of the post and the repercussions of it."
After mediation talks between the two WAGs failed, insiders are now expecting a dramatic courtroom showdown.
"If you thought the Depp trial was box office, don't underestimate this forthcoming WAG war," said a source.
In her legal submission, Mrs Vardy, who has denied involvement, alleges that she was made to feel like a "scapegoat" after Mrs Rooney posted the allegations "in a calculated and deliberate manner that was designed to cause very serious harm and enormous distress."
A source said: "Becky's papers are a sideshow, it is all so spurious."
And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.
The chair of the Icelandic Mental Health Alliance believes the bipolar disorder to be the source of his creativity but a psychiatrist says that it is important for people to take medication to contain the condition.
He later posted several bizarre tweets, including claims that his wife was trying to have him committed to a hospital.
And he's so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful and obviously deep into his powerful connective thinking, because you become aware of this connective thinking that we who have experienced manic episodes know so well."
He has dealt publicly with his bipolar disorder, including on the album Ye.
"Many feel that it restricts the creative element of this unrestrained connective thinking and enormous fiery creative energy that it has, but there are drawbacks of course; frequent pain and lows, dim cellars and darkness."
"If you're experiencing enormous mania, you're not producing anything great, you're just totally wild.

Delhi Metro Casts First Pier Under Phase-4 Work
The Delhi Metro has reached a major milestone in the Phase-4 work as it cast its first pier on the under-construction Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, officials said on Sunday.
The pier was cast at Keshopur on the elevated stretch between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.
Presently, the highest point is at Dhaula Kuan, where the Line 7 viaduct passes at a height of 23.6m.
Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.
They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand.
Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run.
Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.
On 24th June, DMRC had started the casting work of u-girders which would be installed on the elevated section of this corridor.
The country's Covid tally touched the 10 lakh-mark last Friday.
The positivity rate - percentage of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus - is 11 per cent.
India, the third worst-hit country in the global coronavirus tally after US and Brazil, has gradually ramped-up its COVID-19 testing capacity and has conducted over 4.2 lakh tests in a day, the Union Health Ministry said Saturday, crediting the increase to the number of labs for the achievement.
"Paranoid" ambassador wants gun, armoured car and stab-proof vest - called subordinates agents of the "Deep State"
He is also said to have requested an armoured car to transport him from one place to another in Iceland, and a stab-proof vest.
Despite this, jobs listings for bodyguards were placed in Icelandic newspapers, according to CBS, which was part of meeting the ambassador's demands.
Since taking over in May, Gunter is said to have created an "untenable" working environment, having already gone trough seven immediate subordinates, so-called Deputy Chiefs of Mission, who are the ambassador's second in command as well as being posted diplomats.
A staff rotation system was subsequently set up, with the idea of Gunter trying out as many people as possible until he found someone he liked.
CBS furthermore claims that Gunter accused embassy staff of acting on behalf of the "Deep State" and undermining his relationship with the State Department in Washington DC.
The ambassador to South Africa has also been criticised for dismissing her Deputy Chief of Mission and then trying to appoint her son to the post.
The sounds of repeated small detonations rang out in the streets of the city in Washington state, and smoke rose from an area where demonstrators had set fire to trailers by a construction site for the youth detention facility.
Police in riot gear faced off against the demonstrators, some of whom held up umbrellas against falling pellets of pepper spray.
"This ideological element is linked to the imperative to change education in schools and outside of school programs, in terms of learning, attitudes, convictions of the young Polish generation of students to make, in our opinion, the false assumption that biological sex is archaic, and in fact everything comes down to the socio-cultural gender."
But he quickly decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than what happened behind the wheel, and that proved to be a good move for his older brother, who would rely on his engines during his period of dominance.

Pedro Chelsea exit confirmed as team-mates 'serenade' forward in changing room send-off
"The lads have just pretty much serenaded him in the changing room and rightly so because of the career he has had generally and for this club.
"He is here for the remainder of games, but a big player of the club leaves and the spirit of the club I saw afterwards was pretty special."
He did not follow the police's repeated orders to leave, so he "earned himself" an extension of his stay with the police, to quote the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police Diary.
The air interdiction missions conducted by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp belonging to the armed gang headed by the bandit leader known as "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest area of Zamfara State.
The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche said the airstrike, which also resulted in the killing of several armed bandits, was executed following Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of confirmatory aerial surveillance missions.
Major General Enenche said the HUMINT established that members of the gang, along with their logistics items, motorcycles and hundreds of rustled livestock, had relocated from their erstwhile position to the new area by a rocky high ground within the Forest.
Enenche said the Air Component, therefore, dispatched an enhanced force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location.
According to him "the attack aircraft engaged the target area scoring accurate hits and taking out some of the bandits.
Many others, who were seen trying to flee the location in disarray, were mopped-up in follow-on attacks."
While commending the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, urged them to remain resolute in the conduct of airstrikes against armed bandits.
The man was diagnosed in the border city of Kaesong, which has now been isolated and a curfew imposed on its residents.

Serbia seeks more warplanes amid Balkan tensions
President Aleksandar Vucic said "certain initiatives" have been made to buy a fleet of fighter-bombers, accusing the U.S. and other Western countries of arming Serbia's NATO neighbors and its breakaway former province of Kosovo.
During a tour of a Serbian army tank brigade, Vucic said his country cannot compete with "NATO donations" to its neighbors when it comes to weapons, "therefore we must do it alone."
The Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia is being watched with unease in the West and among Serbia's neighbors.
Collectible campaigns such as Little Shop were primarily pioneered by Coles in Australia, with the first iteration launching in mid-2018, fuelling one of the supermarket's best-ever single-quarter sales results.
However, with UBS analysts predicting Australia's supermarket sector to have COVID-inflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year, the impact of Coles' new collectibles could be far more muted this time.

Congress Was Already Broken.  The Coronavirus Could Make It Worse.
The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices.
It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.
In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true.
Rep. Val Demings talks VP candidacy, blasts Trump for pardons
Demings served as one of seven House Impeachment Managers during the January trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of the Senate acquittal, history will forever note that he is the fourth commander-in-chief to be impeached.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she objects to Trump commuting the prison sentence of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other felonies) as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes, stating, "The gall of pardoning your friends, those who lied and cheated to cover up for your wrongdoings."
Then, while laughing, she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream, adding, "If y'all want to make a call... go ahead."
This fact was not lost on Demings.
Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if defeated, and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself, Demings became animated, "To even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach."

FDNY diversity official says 'most definitely' OK to exclude white firefighter from color guard
An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.
According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.
Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.
Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.
During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'
Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'
In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.
'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.
The knife was confiscated and a statement taken from the man in question.
The police dealt with approximately eighty matters between 5 PM and 5 AM and six people had been detained in a holding cell this morning.
Police stopped the driver of a vehicle towing a caravan, as the caravan's running gear was in very poor condition.

Degtaryev has completely ignored these calls.
There were almost as many protesters yesterday as in the first protest, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: The release of Furgal and the resignation of President Putin.
However, the same analysts told the BBC that Furgal's victory in the governor elections — which was clear and decisive — had been a considerable shock for Putin and United Russia, and an indication of the Kremlin's weakening hold on the eastern regions.
