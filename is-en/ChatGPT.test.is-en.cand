In recent weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet regarding racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
Ashwell Prince, former cricket star of the Proteas, made his white former teammates hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying he and other black teammates were "quota players".
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada achieved top accolades in the sport, some people still connected it to the quota debate.

Members of the Independence Party got angry when the trade union of public and general employees told its members to resist when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplace.
"It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to their jobs while employees in warehouses and factories across the country have continued to work so that public employees could eat during this time," he said.
Many of these employees now want to go on summer vacation but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to return to their workplaces, even though it is safe.
The labor union of public and general employees has acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but maintains that "small and often cramped offices" make it difficult for the 4,000-person workforce of the passport service to maintain necessary distance.

"This depended on how the property was composed, that it was three acres, and that it was in this location," said Grgic.
In the discussion, CBS also discusses various difficulties that have been challenging for the American embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy ambassador seven times.
The first alternate ambassador is said to have prepared himself for a long time for his job and learned Icelandic only to be denied the position at the last minute because Gunter "didn't like him" at their first meeting.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards and instead had a temporary replacement take care of his duties for several months, all during the midst of a global pandemic.
In the discussion, CBS also mentions the unpopularity of Gunter in Iceland, especially in relation to his tweet where he calls the coronavirus "the invisible Chinese virus" and has received a lot of criticism for it.

The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after making a name for himself on Fight Island, but he claims he is not aiming to flaunt his wealth in an extravagant way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev defeated Rhys McKee from Northern Ireland in their welterweight fight in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, when he defeated his opponent in the first round by making the punches land on him on the floor after three minutes and nine seconds had passed.
Sigurinn registered the name Chimaev in the history books of UFC for the shortest time between victories in the modern history of the competition, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated Briton John Phillips in an equally decisive manner, then in a middleweight bout.
Chimaev, who has a win ratio of 8-0, received a $50,000 bonus for his performance of the evening against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now referred to as "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be an inevitable comparison due to the great similarities between Chimaev's achievements and the UFC lightweight champion's, and also because he was born in Téténía, which is close to Khabib's hometown in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial gain, the highly praised Chimaev has said that he would not be eager to flaunt his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his counterpart in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
He has, among other things, caught the attention of Conor McGregor's teammates and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on social media that he could "easily" defeat Chimaev with a submission.
There was no poisonous response from the warrior who goes by the name "Borz" or "wolf" in his native language of Tétenska, which said that he would "grind Denmark with his eyes closed".
Chimaev, who is currently residing in Stockholm, Sweden after moving to the country at the age of 19, may not prioritize his financial wealth, but he is clearly confident in his fighting abilities.
"I can paint anyone ..."
"I can paint all of them," he said.
"Give me 77 kilograms of master (rolling weight), 84 kilograms of master (mill weight), I will grind both of them on the same day."
The participants also crossed over to the Alameda exit on Highway 101 but later abandoned it.

The authorities in Karnataka have issued that only 50 people may gather in mosques for prayers during Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer gatherings at Eidgah and other places due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The ministry says in the directive that more than the allotted prayer hours should be divided up.
Prayer meetings may not be held anywhere else, such as community centers, social facilities, or "Shadi Mahal", as stated.
The Icelandic government allows churches, mosques, and other places of worship to be open to those who want to pray from June 8th, provided that proper precautions are taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Increased burden in protests against racial discrimination in the United States
Two cases of Covid-19 were detected in the country last Thursday, with each type of the virus.
After analysis by Icelandic genetic testing, it was revealed that the two individuals who tested positive for the virus and are connected have a new variant of it that has not been detected before in this country.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Chief Epidemiologist's Office and deputy chief epidemiologist, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now investigating where this type of virus is most likely to have come from.
"Yes, this is so different from what has been found here before that there are actually no chances that this has been something to mess with here," Kamilla answers.
There is a good chance that these individuals have somehow come into contact with someone who is new to a place, without knowing it themselves.
We will be on our toes in the next few days to keep an eye on it.
Do you assume that there is community transmission going on now?
"It hasn't been recently, but it's not ruled out because we don't know who has transmitted this infection to these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday on one hand and yesterday on the other." she answers.
This is how it can be expected that the Department of Infectious Diseases and Virology of Landspitali will provide in the sampling in the coming days in order to try to better map the situation here domestically.

Google Pixel 4 can capture the Northern Lights.
Double optical zoom makes it possible to see in 3D and thus deliver better depth in the background with the portrait mode on the Pixel 4, compared to previous Pixel phones, which relied entirely on software to achieve these so-called "bokeh" effects.
In addition to another camera lens, the Pixel 4 Soli introduces "gesture controls" on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can skip songs, turn off alarms, set a timer, or mute the phone by waving their hand.

Giant from Christmastown in Laxá in Dölum
The first hundred salmon were caught in Laxá in Dölum later today.
He had put on a snowsuit in Christmastown this morning and it was 89 centimeters.
After noon, he had the opportunity to visit Kristnapollur again and thought about the story he had heard that the heron often follows the raven after it has caught its prey.
With this in mind, he took the Collie Dog cone and threw it over Kristnapoll.
He quickly got a grip and as he himself tells.
"After about five seconds, he completely cleaned himself and I realized that this was the meter."
I became a little stressed because I had an eleven-pound weight.
Usually I catch fish quickly but I had this one for forty minutes.
He was actually quite comfortable.
Took several trips up and down the pool, but then I managed to reach the shore and it was an amazing feeling.

Curse of the Joy Squad - Terrible fate of the Glee Stars
That theory has gained popularity on the Internet regarding the curse over the series about Gleðisveitina, as the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently and thus became the third main actor of the series to pass away at a young age.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a tough character who didn't always show her softer side.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to success and respect.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to be looking much better.

"I believe there are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes fishing in the summers but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
"The income is also good for me during the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who enjoys beach fishing in the summer like previous summers.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and had stopped going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.

"I have also experienced the northern lights, but my favorite is the green ones," says Axel, who always wakes up early in the morning and sometimes claims to talk to the moon and sing to the sky, during those solitary times out on the open sea."
"In shore fishing, I am never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I have been continuously fishing for one and a half rotations of the sun out at sea."
The arrangement in beach fishing says that he can catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds overwhelming.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to work instead of having 48 days off during the entire summer and being able to choose according to their own preferences.
"So the division of areas should also go my way, and the fishing grounds that are well located near the fishing grounds should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who mainly catches cod from the salty sea on his shore fishing trips, but also occasionally catches other species.
Axel spends the winter studying at the university at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur.
An error in registration prevented the implementation of home quarantine measures.
Therefore, the person in question has not received an automatic invitation to come for a test.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules of home quarantine, even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been aware of sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.

Preparing to move several institutions abroad.
This was said by the Minister in the show Sprengisandi on Bylgjan at noon.
Six experts in forensic science work at the institution, but none of them intend to follow the institution north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulance Workers has criticized the relocation of the funeral processions.
"Further relocation," said Ásmundur.

Brynjólfur is suspended due to four warnings during the game time and therefore does not show up to play with the new lineup as in the games until now.
"I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this person was rather trying in the game."

The cyclist Bjartmar has reclaimed bicycles worth millions - Now answers for himself after discussion in DV.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bicycle whisperer" recently.
DV referred to this in discussions on the Facebook group of Vesturbæingar, where it was revealed that Bjartmar had approached the man on Austurvöllur and said that the scooter might possibly be stolen.
There was no other way to interpret from the original writings of the electrician than that Bjartmar had accused him of being a thief.
Bjartmar said he had received information from a victim of electrocution that these were indeed his electric scooters.
"I looked at the guy and I examined the bag, as there was information that there was an electric scooter missing for a very long time and had been searched for."
I definitely hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to leave on the shuttle, I decided to approach and talk to the man.
Generally, I do very well in such matters, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man interrupted me.
So the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of his electric scooter and drove off.
In this past year that Bjartmar has dedicated to his hobby, he claims to have encountered countless situations where he felt like he was dealing with people from a completely different world.
"I have had peaceful communication with the most difficult men of Reykjavik," said Bjartmar and points out that bicycle thieves are often the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally disabled people, and other people who, for some reason, are on the streets.
"The addiction is a tough master and somehow one needs to finance the next dose, unfortunately theft is an easy way to achieve that goal," says Bjartmar.
"Examples exist of people who have sought treatment, taken care of themselves, and then reached out to me and assisted me with what I am doing," he says.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started pointing out to people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news coverage of DV and claims not to be some kind of self-appointed police in personal pursuit of justice.
Asked whether he has now nevertheless come onto thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says it is certainly so.
She is completely powerless in these matters, to put it bluntly.
He claims to have achieved such great success in riding a bicycle that sometimes he runs into his "accomplices" on the street, who then only have the bright Bjartmar bicycles they had previously obtained.
There are electric scooters, electric bicycles, and electric skateboards available there, but an electric bicycle can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day at a preschool and every other weekend he works at a cohabitation.
All these rights cost a great and fierce struggle but turned out, in retrospect, to be a much greater and lasting wage increase than the multiplication of the krona in the wage index, which disappeared just as harshly in the hot inflation that characterized the period after the war and until 1990, as many will remember.
This is all brought up here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of Icelandic, "shadow governance".
Since the word is used in the language, it is not expected that it has been defined precisely, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most accepted": Shadow governance is when a leader in a trade union publicly announces that they intend to give recommendations or instructions to the representatives of the union in the management of the pension fund on how they should take a stance on a specific issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be forced to step down from power at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not "shadow control" however, such communication between people is naturally always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader contemplate which path he finds "darker."
The occasion arose for both after Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and cabin crew (terminate their employment), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the Reykjavik Trade Union, then issued those recommendations to the company's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Trade Union Members to not support the potential purchase of shares in the company by the fund, otherwise they might be forced to resign.
However, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to elaborate on the matter in last Friday's issue of Fréttablaðið, using strong words about corruption, law-breaking, and the urgent need for changes in the laws.
There was a small mound that truly had to roll a heavy load, even though the blessed mound had been in a receptive state and also quickly dried out.
Since the matter is important, we should focus on the substance itself in the end.
In it lies that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these matters are further elaborated in the approved documents of both Gildi and Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna as I mentioned.
As things got better, he realized it himself and took this back.
The time will reveal whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund's members when the time comes.
One of the infected individuals did not observe the home quarantine.
He got a negative impression at the border.
"But he is in the Icelandic community and actually should resort to it," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the National Health Institute and deputy chief epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form, and there is no obligation to register the social security number, and if the social security number is not registered, you will not be automatically invited to the next appointment."
"When the social security number is not registered, you need to personally go and attend the later appointment."
So it is clear that we need to enhance the information system about this while we find a way to create an automatic notification system even though Icelanders do not register their social security number.
As it goes, the person in question manages to avoid the attention, despite being involved in the community and being an Icelander.
There have been no more cases detected within a 24-hour period since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards begin to ease the strictest lockdown in Europe.
Others who were sent into quarantine are connected to the man in a different way.
Yesterday, pictures of the match caught attention where it could be seen in very close proximity that the team celebrated their good performance on the field.
