On July 17th, Icelandair decided to terminate the employment of all 38 flight attendants who were working for the company while the wage dispute at the Flight Attendants Union was still unresolved.
There were discussions about whether Icelandair could have taken advantage of these statements and it was prepared for the matter to be resolved in court.
However, they never reached an agreement, and the flight attendants and Icelandair parted ways after a short period of time.
When you are in negotiations, when you are inside the mediator's office, then it is not an option to go this way.

Preparing for further relocation of public institutions abroad
The Department of Housing and Construction's Search and Rescue Division will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the fall, according to the Minister's decision, but specialists within the department have previously expressed that they do not intend to relocate their livestock north.
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, said on Sprengisandur on Bylgjan this morning that it is important for rural areas that public institutions are moved there.
"Job creation, currency-generating development, whether it is in tourism, agriculture, industry, any kind of natural resource utilization, and these types of activities as public employment, they support the development very well," says Ásmundur.
"Creates increased diversity, creates better support for this resource utilization and economic growth of the nation."
"I believe it is quite clear that there are politically divided opinions on how harshly to proceed with this."

"If the virus spreads unchecked in society, it becomes very difficult to open in that condition," said Gottlieb on "Face the Nation."
In the instructions, among other things, it is called for that in schools there should be a distance between people ensured, students and staff are advised to use face masks, and that students should be divided into limited groups to reduce the spread of infection.
If between 5 to 10% of diagnoses yield a positive result, "the matter may be complicated", but if it is over 10%, "the threshold when one needs to carefully consider whether to close the school examples."
"This is a sign that the epidemic has gained a foothold in society," said Gottlieb, adding that this would make it difficult for the state of Florida, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States, to open schools for instruction next month.
The coronavirus infection has increased in more than 30 countries and in the Colombian region, but the epicenter of the epidemic is currently located in the so-called Sun Belt, near the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to adopt responsibility for their carbon footprint, especially where the risk is considered significant.
Crystal Palace supporters got a scare for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the club's manager, announced that the talented attacker Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the club.
Since he has now turned 27 years old, it remains to be seen whether teams in that quality category are still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four goals and made five assists for the Palace team, which caused some disappointments.
Zaha found the net only once from mid-December until the end of the period with a long-range shot in a loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had requested a sale last summer when he tried to break free from the company, but no offers were received to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed representatives in January, which seems to increase the chances of leaving the company, and in the coming weeks, it will undoubtedly be a priority for him to secure a transfer.
Zaha is the player who played the most minutes in the English Premier League for Palace during the season and was the only player on the team younger than 28 years old who played 1100 minutes or more, which shows how much rebuilding the team may require by investing in him.
Hanna was the first hurricane of the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be cautious: "This is not close to being over yet. We still have the possibility of storm surges."
"This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has become the worst affected due to COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first reached land at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 kilometers south of Corpus Christi.
I think that many have become weak.

"It is lively, yes, yes, it has actually been very comfortable now for the last half month or three weeks, it has been so dry and good and then it is so comfortable to deal with this."
But Sigurður believes that some farmers will cut three times.
Yes, I could totally believe that, those who were first.
We started on June 17th, it could very well be that those who were first have to take something three times.
His opponents have had it in them to grab him to make sure he doesn't get past them.
News about Prince Harry: Friend of the Duke of Sussex contradicts claims in a new book that have been circulating among people.

Turkish dove, rose starling, ringed dove, whimbrel, glittering bristle and grey heron are among the birds that have arrived here this summer.
On the website of the Birdwatching Station of Southeast Iceland, fuglar.is, you can see short news about the migratory birds almost daily, where they have been spotted, and sometimes their gender.
He speaks beautifully about these animals that enrich the ecosystem in Iceland and play an important role there, and it doesn't matter whether the bird is a large and mighty predator or a small songbird.
Hálfdán and his siblings at Kvískerjar sparked the interest of many who got to know them in Icelandic nature.
The internet is up every day, at least from around six in the morning until noon.
And they need to visit them every hour.
Yes, we exchanged this between us, me and Bjössi.
Between monitoring the nets and during the times when they are not up, Brynjúlfur and Björn are marking sheep, inspecting and various seabirds where they can reach them.
"The woodpecker jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then takes them here to land in the spring."
This happens shortly before they set off, and that is why these mules are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
So he jumps off the bird and tries to find another shelter when he needs to.
Brynjúlfur says that the nesting of the birds in Southeast Iceland seems to be going well this summer, as they are laying eggs.
"Aðal, the ewe, gave birth here by Hala in Suðursveit and everything is going well."
But on the other hand, there is no longer any glacier calving to be found at Jökulsárlón, where a few years ago there was a huge glacier calving.
He says that a few years ago there were over a thousand seals there, but now it is possible to count them on the fingers of one hand.
"When we look at seagulls and waterfowl, I feel that it has decreased in recent years what one finds of them."
What can explain the significant change is most likely Brynjólfur's statement about the availability of food.
"This is all about food."
Then the work of humans can also have something to say about the outcome of birds and other animals.
"One of the positive things I find about the economy is that it is growing again after a significant recession," says Brynjúlfur, "but meanwhile, the unemployment rate has skyrocketed in recent years and decades."
It seems that the puffins are doing well in their breeding season this summer, just like last year.
But let's turn to the refugees.
They often attract a lot of attention, especially if they are very flashy and even colorful.
These two interesting factors revolve around the most popular hiking trail of the summer: Rósarstarr.
"Otherwise, it has been relatively calm in the bird colonies this summer," says Brynjúlfur, but mentions that a grey heron has now been found in the countryside and that ringed plovers have been seen and are starting to nest here.
When Brynjúlfur and Björn encounter migrating birds, they also mark them, just like other birds.
Meanings are international and they are practiced all around the world.
Various meanings can be derived, for example, where the winter habitats of the birds are, where they lay their eggs, and what their migration routes are.
A puffin from us was later found in the United States.
One bird is particularly playful to Brynjúlfur and that is the seagull.
"The seagull is ours," he says and points out that the Bird Observation Station and the Southeast Iceland Nature Center have the task of monitoring its progress - which has become quite poor and now it is on the endangered list."
It is difficult to assert what caused the collapse in the population, but one theory is that the seagull has found a new food source that was previously discarded by fishing boats into the sea, but now it is being utilized much better and that has an impact on the seagull.
"You naturally won't get me to say no," says Brynjúlfur laughing and adds: "Since we are also dealing with migratory birds now, we definitely need to go further."
"This area is like drawn into the country from Europe, but then the birds scatter from here."
"Bjúgnefja is my bird because I have found nine out of the ten that are known to exist in the country," he finally answers.
"I find it most enjoyable to take pictures of horses."
The Crown Prince says that it is not up for discussion that women can be exempt from covering their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time acknowledges that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot there when the sun is high in the sky and it is not possible to rely on air conditioning.
But one can wonder whether it also diminishes the interest of prospective travelers if they cannot buy alcohol for themselves.

Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he had little involvement in the LaLiga celebrations of Los Blancos, and now this summer the situation has arisen that the player intends to keep quiet and let his contract expire, but the club hopes that he will leave.
"There is no way to avoid the circumstances becoming unacceptable for everyone," Kroos said in the podcast Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
"He was not bought to play him as little as he is now in reality."
I think that in reality he wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then said "no" later.

Those who have set foot on the land have also been fortunate with the weather and weather forecasts from DV, in one word, that the summer has simply been beautiful, to say the least.
But now it is approaching a trade union weekend which has so far been the busiest travel weekend of the year.
It is sufficient to mention the national festival as an example.
The meteorologist Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in his forecast on his weather website, Blik, that calm weather is expected for the long weekend.
He says: Low pressure systems in the upper atmosphere, accompanied by frequent cold, also often descend down to the surface, resulting in when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, only a depression with wind and precipitation forms.
When she approaches, she is close to "blossoming" in the form of decreasing air pressure and a delightful summer mood.
The large high-pressure system, the European forecasting center to the left on the map, and the American GFS forecast to the right are somewhat concurrent with this development.
According to the forecast, the low pressure system will move slowly over on Thursday evening and early on Friday with a strong northerly wind and rain across most of the country.
The low pressure system of 985 hPa then follows in its wake.
However, it could blow at the same time.
A person was seriously injured when a car with cattle equipment rolled over in Wexford.
A runaway truck raced towards the bridge and crashed into an empty stationary car.

"I was shot in her like one gets such a childhood shot," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the main actress of the show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
When Birna was a teenager, at the age when many start to develop intense infatuations, she did not experience it like her peers because she was strict in suppressing her own emotions.
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a hidden phase of self-discovery.
"We spend our teenage years burying these teenage passions, these shots and such."
The actress slipped on the ice when she was standing in New York a few years ago.
It is rumored that Birna is a big fan of Mariska.
When the movie ends, the group applauds and Birna tries one last time to convince the woman to try to make the meeting work.
"I look at the phone and scream above me."
"I don't know when they start or when they end, but this is the name of the hotel, take care," it says in the message, and Birna dresses quickly. She asks at the reception where the meeting takes place and takes the elevator up to the 45th floor where the group has gathered.
Birna takes care of herself and waits there until a woman from the team comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can assist.
The actors regularly appear when there is a break in the scenes, they grab a snack and Birna looks around and searches for Mariska who is nowhere to be seen.
Birna asks him to pass her to another colleague because nothing happened to her immediately.
Curious, the friend approves of it and approaches another employee.
He says: River.
She goes straight to the car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her bicycle shed.
"So I look to the right and lose my face" Birna starts running and goes down to Times Square with the lift.
Mariska cannot find her bicycle shed, and then frustration starts to creep up on her.
Vondauf continues to lead Birna back towards the hotel where she looks in through the window, observing herself with a worried expression, as it is clear that Birna did not accomplish her intended task.
So I look to the right and lose my face.
No one else but Mariska Hargitay stood there in the jumpsuit she wears on the show, and Birna recognized her immediately — but Birna could hardly move from the shock.
Birna does it and psyches herself up to poke the actress on the shoulder.
The conversation didn't progress much further because Mariska's car arrived and attention was drawn to it.
Birna bids farewell to the idol of superstition, watches the car drive away, and then collapses.
"I called laughing to Erling and Gunna and they thought that this had not worked."
But I was crying from excitement and joy.
"So we mixed soda water and tequila," says Birna.
This is what a police officer in the traffic department of the police in the capital area says in a conversation with mbl.is.
Suggestions have been received by mbl.is from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police stop them, come to a traffic street and make everyone passing by blow.
The police say the utmost cleanliness is maintained.
"In fact, there are no specific mouthpieces, but we have a cup that people blow into," says the police officer.
Tried it positively, the police are used in a different way.
The sentence translates to: "The suggestion is: Among other things, it is possible to consume anise to reduce pain."
If the swelling does not decrease, it could be a food intolerance.
In her ruling on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected time limits by stating that immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to release children from custody if it is not possible to do so through any of the three methods described in her previous directive.
However, GEE also emphasized in its directive that immigration and customs authorities should still be obliged to release children from custody without unnecessary delay.
Gee, who is in charge of implementing the Flores Agreement regarding the detention of children, said in June that since "rules regarding the use of restraints and social isolation were not followed or poorly followed," it was crucial to move children away from these facilities.
969 individuals who are in custody with immigration and customs authorities have tested positive for the coronavirus and are in isolation or under surveillance from and including July 23rd, according to immigration and customs authorities.

"The unbearable traffic congestion at Ölfusárbrú," says the mayor of Árborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in Árborg recently had a meeting with the director of the Road Administration and the designer of the Road Administration, and that meeting was very positive.
"If someone has ever been optimistic about the fact that progress is being made in these matters, I believe I can say that now because there is really progress being made and we should be able to see a new bridge being offered this autumn."
"Yes, it is possible to go through the narrow passage and through Eyrarbakki, it is faster for those who are going eastward, it is not possible to suggest to them to go through Lyngdalsheiði but those who are going to the highlands should use Mosfellsheiði, Þingvellir and Lyngdalsheiði."
Helgi S. Haraldsson, the president of the Árborg municipality, who says the traffic congestion that forms at the Ölfusárbrú bridge near Selfoss is intolerable.
The future of the koala habitat in the northern part of Brisbane is subject to planning regulations.
The city council said that in addition to the fact that the area is vital habitat for the koala bear, the swift parrot, and the grey goshawk, it is an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
The executing parties argue that despite the proposal being fully in line with the plan, it could be changed if it does not meet the requirements, rather than rejecting it.
The leader of the minority in the Brisbane city council said that the city needed to buy the land to protect the koala bear.
Schrinner said that mapping of the habitats of koalas is a joint responsibility of the city government and the national government, but the national government is responsible for detailed maps of koala habitats that local authorities rely on when processing applications for development.
I think that the underdogs may have possibly overcome the mental barrier by winning such a big game, since we have lost twice in the quarterfinals during this period.
Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, expressed concerns about Kiev's call to review the Minsk agreement and stated that Volodymyr Zelensky's stance on the "inviolability of the Minsk agreement, which he once again emphasized in this phone conversation, should be reflected in real actions."
Zelensky, on the other hand, emphasized the necessity of taking "further actions" to rescue the Ukrainian citizens who are prisoners of the insurgents in Eastern Ukraine, on the annexed Crimean Peninsula, and in Russia, according to a statement from the President's office.
At the traditional Sunday blessing on Péturs Square, Pope Francis also recalled the ceasefire and said that it was necessary to "rebuild trust and lay the foundation for a very necessary and long-lasting peace with the people".
The protests were live-streamed on Facebook and there, one could hear the honking of the car and several shots being fired.
Blika's first victory in July is a landmark soup.
Skagamenn lose again in their third consecutive game in the league.
It was either to succeed or perish for Blika, who entered the game with great force.
The Skagafjörður men neither reached the lands nor the shores in the first half of the game, as the high pressure from the home team made it extremely difficult for them to connect passes.
The lights were all on the field and they cut the third goal at the 36th minute when Danish Thomas Mikkelsen headed in Höskuldur Gunnlaugsson's corner kick.
The Skagamenn got a hopeful smile for the latter when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty kick shortly before halftime, but Kwame Quee had then broken Viktor Jónsson's shinbone inside the penalty area.
The score was 4-1 for Breiðablik when the halftime whistle blew.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was then alone and unchallenged on the Blika playing field and easily directed the ball into the net after Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson's corner kick.
Hlynur, on the other hand, became a criminal within the ÍA team only three minutes later when he attacked Alexander Helgi.
Breiðablik won their first victory in almost a month, since June 29th, and is now in third place with 14 points, two points behind Val who is in a higher position and three points behind the top team KR.
KR and Valur both have a game inside at Blika.
ÍA has to accept the third consecutive loss in the league, but the team has ten points in eighth place, five points away from the relegation zone.
The police force is not in danger despite the remarks of the White House.
The producers of the Hvolpasveit show decided yesterday that they would not stop showing the children's program in the near future.

"I have both the shows Cops and Live PD," McEnany said on Friday.
This has sometimes caused hostility and mistrust in relationships, whether the other party is looking around, thinking about infidelity, or even considering separation and change.
When we discuss this, we agree that we need to nurture our relationship, but this is like a cloud that always hangs over us.
What would scare me is if you were thinking this to yourselves in either corner, not discussing it and even taking a step that you could later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always the best?
The reason why relationships that start in adolescence do not always last a lifetime is often that people develop in different directions, but in those cases where there are mutual influences, the individuals can become a stronger unit than many others.
What does this many years give us a special position?
I allow myself to assert that the advantages can be quite a lot more than the disadvantages.
But this is not only accompanied by pink clouds and happiness, oh no, in your lifetime this can become a complicated task, which may possibly never go as smoothly as you have already done with each other.
You have not put your shoes on the hill.
I lost the cup and crushed it.

Coleen Rooney accuses lawyer Johnny Depp in the "Wagatha Christie" rhyme against Rebekah Vardy.
After discussions between the spouses of the football players leaked out, their friends are expecting a dramatic confrontation.
Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity lawyer in the highly publicized defamation case against Rebekah Vardy, known as the "Wagatha Christie" lawsuit, to defend herself.
The Mail on Sunday claims that Rooney has hired David Sherborne to defend herself against accusations that she had spread rumors about Vardy, with allegations that personal information had been leaked to the media from her private Instagram account.
In the article it is mentioned that the mother of five children, who is 38 years old, had "experienced severe depression and anxiety attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house" and that Vardy, who was then seven months old, "had been admitted to the hospital three times ... due to anxiety attacks that can be attributed to the birth and its consequences."
After the negotiations between the two football club owners failed, those who are familiar with the dramatic confrontation in the courtroom are expecting it.
"If you found the Depp-right-holdings spectacle, you should not underestimate the anticipated war of the football team owners," said the source.
In the court documents, Vardy, who denies involvement in the case, argues that she has been made a scapegoat after Rooney published the accusations "with the aim of causing significant harm and immense suffering".
The source said: "Becky's documents are misleading, this is all a fabrication."
And the polls indicate that states that were previously reliable Republican strongholds, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
The Chairman of Mental Health believes that he should channel his creative energy into his mental illness, but the psychiatrist says it is important for people to take medication to keep the disease under control.
Later, several peculiar tweets from him appeared on Twitter, where he stated among other things that his wife was trying to have him admitted to the hospital.
And he is so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful, and clearly in his powerful mindset, because one becomes aware of this mindset that we, who have had the opportunity to experience going into a state of frenzy, know so well.
He has talked about mental health, among other things on the album Ye.
"Many find it oppressive, this creative element that lies in this unbounded associative thinking and the excessively destructive creative power of fire that it possesses, but naturally there are often great sufferings in it, and age-old valleys and dark cellars and darkness."

Delhi Metro installs the first pillar at the fourth stage of construction.
The Delhi Metro achieved an important milestone in the fourth stage of construction when the first pillar was cast for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is currently being laid, according to employees on Sunday.
The pole was cast in Keshopur and on an elevated part between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday evening.
However, the poles will be at a height of 20 meters at Madhuban Chowk, where the road intersects with road 1, and 25 meters at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the road meets road 2.
The highest point of the electrical system is currently located at Dhaula Kuan, where the bridge road reaches a height of 23.6 meters.
In the context of civil engineering, columns are vertically load-bearing structures that support the adjacent ends of two tracks.
They construct vertical structures that support the elevated railway track of the train system.
This power pole can be seen on the many main roads that run under the power lines in Delhi.
The numbers on the chairs now play an important role as a guide for home addresses in the Delhi metropolitan area.
On June 24th, the DMRC began casting the U-bearing piece that would later be placed in an elevated section of the route.
The population reached 1 million last Friday.
The percentage of patients diagnosed with the coronavirus is 11%.
Iceland, which is in third place among the countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic after the United States and Brazil, has gradually increased its testing capacity for COVID-19 and has conducted more than 420 thousand tests in one day, said the Ministry of Health on Saturday, which attributes this achievement to the expansion of research facilities.
"The ambassador, who is addicted to luxury, wants a gun, an armored car, and a bulletproof vest - The subordinates said he is a representative of the 'deep state'."
He should also have wished for an armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and Stungunesti.
Although it had been advertised for lifeguards in Icelandic newspapers, says CBS, and that is part of meeting the demands of the ambassador.
Since Gunter took over in May, he is said to have created an "impossible" working environment at the embassy and he already has seven subordinates, so-called Deputy Chiefs of Mission, who are also diplomats sent abroad.
In the aftermath, the staff had been rotated and the idea was to have Gunter meet most of them until he found someone he liked.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter has expected embassy staff to carry out the "deep state" mission and to have undermined him towards the State Department in Washington D.C.
The ambassador in South Africa has also been criticized for firing two of his staff members and attempting to appoint his son to the position.
Repeated explosions echoed through the streets of the city of Seattle in the state of Washington, and smoke filled the area where protesters had set fire to bicycles near the youth detention center.

There were already breaches in the parliament. The coronavirus could make them worse.
In the investigation, familiar factors are examined in relation to the concerning state of the parliament: lack of real connections between parties, an agenda that limits opportunities for communication, excessive concentration of power in leadership positions, constant demands for financial contributions, discussions about cooperation between parties, negative influence of media that are active around the clock, the fact that the most important elections for parliament members are often pre-elections, and finally, the silence of minority parties.
It is also warned that the parliament may move more towards online platforms due to the pandemic, where such a system, which allows voting with the help of proxies in the representative chamber without the need for MPs to travel to Washington, could further increase the existing problems.

The congresswoman Val Demings discusses the vice presidency, making sure Trump hears it loud and clear.
Demings was one of four impeachment managers representing the House of Representatives in the Senate trial of Donald Trump in January.
Regardless of whether the impeachment of Trump by the Senate happens, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be impeached.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she is opposed to Trump's pardon of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other crimes) and his pardoning of other criminals convicted of similar offenses, as she said, "It is a disgrace to pardon your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your wrongdoing."
Then she moved her hand to her mouth while laughing and pretended to whisper to those who were watching the live broadcast, and added, "If you feel like calling... you can do it on my behalf."
This did not go unnoticed by Demings.
"When she responded to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's words about Trump potentially refusing to leave the White House if he loses the election, and another editorial that says the president is preparing to pardon himself, Demings exclaimed: 'The mere suggestion of pardoning oneself made me uneasy'."

The representative of the New York City Fire Department says it is "completely" acceptable to exclude a white firefighter from an honor ceremony.
A representative who deals with diversity issues at the New York City Fire Department says it is "completely" acceptable to exclude a white firefighter from an honor ceremony so that all participants can be black, according to a recent news article.
According to dear McWilliams, the maintenance department of the fire brigade had chosen him to be one of the flag bearers in the honorary procession at the memorial event.
When he arrived at the event, he was nevertheless meant to participate in the honorary ceremony of the former president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, because it was claimed that she had requested that all flag bearers at the mass be black.
Among the things that are claimed she asked him to do is to provide support to unchanged citizens and organize uniformed firefighters away from the mass.
When Loving, who is black, testified for the prosecution, lawyer McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, asked her the following: "So, requesting that everyone be black in the jury is not discrimination?"
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to request that everyone be dressed in black at the ceremony, to which she answered: "Absolutely".
In the draft, Sullivan wrote that it had been "appalling" to exclude McWilliams from the honor at the mass and indicate that one rule did not apply to everyone in the fire department.
"The New York City Fire Department has created a policy and process intended to accommodate members of the Vulcan Society, who behave in a racist manner, excuse their actions, and support them... and this needs to be stopped," Sullivan also wrote.
The knife was examined and a report was made by the person involved.
Approximately eighty cases were brought to the attention of the police in the capital area from 5 pm to 5 am, and this morning six were detained in custody.

They have let the calls of Degtaryev whistle like wind in their ears.
