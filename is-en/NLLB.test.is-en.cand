In recent weeks it has become clear that many bones are still in the closet in relation to racial injustice in sports in South Africa.
Ashwell Prince, a former Proteas cricket star, let his white former teammates hear it, accusing them of racism by calling him and other black team members "quota players".
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada reached the highest standards in the sport, some people still associated them with the quota issue.

Conservative lawmakers were outraged when a union of public and general employees told its members to question their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories across the country have continued to work so that public servants can eat while this has been happening, he said.
Many of these workers now want to go on summer vacation but cannot because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplace, even if it is safe.

The CBS report says that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iceland has not provided information on whether a request has been received from the United States about the possible arming of Gunter, because the authorities do not comment on the security measures of foreign diplomats.
He already had seven second-in-command staff at the embassy as of May last year.

"Bigger is better" is apparently the motto of the new owners of a huge property in the Lovely Banks district, which was recently sold for A$1,270.
"It was because of the way the property was built, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place", Grgic said.
The CBS report also discusses the various problems that have plagued the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already changed his deputy ambassador seven times.
Thus, the First Deputy is said to have prepared for his job for a long time and learned Icelandic only to be denied the position at the last minute because Gunter "did not speak to him" at their first meeting.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to attend a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland as a result, leaving his temporary replacement to do his job so months apart, in the midst of a global recession.
The CBS report also reports on Gunter's unpleasant experiences in Iceland, especially in connection with the episode in which he calls the coronavirus the "visible Chinese virus" and has received much criticism.
Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Party says constitutional crisis in the state; Congress party wants votes

Russian fighter Khamzat Chimaev is now being touted as the next UFC star after making history at Fight Island, but he says he's not aiming to flag his fight in a hyperbolic way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev defeated Northern Ireland's Colonel Rhys McKee in their battle of wits in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, defeating his opponent with three minutes and nine seconds left in the first round by having his punches dribble on the floor.
The victory entered Chimaev's name into the UFC history books for the shortest winning time in the modern history of the event, as only 10 days had passed since he defeated Britain's John Phillips by a similar margin, then in the middleweight division.
Chimaev, who has an 8-0 win-loss record, received a $50,000 bonus for his performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so thoroughly that he is now referred to as Khalib 2.0, which they say is an inevitable comparison because of the similarities between Chimaev's stature and the UFC lightweight champion and his birthplace in Tetenya, which is closer to Khabib's hometown in Dagestan.
Despite his newfound fame and financial success, the German-born Chimaev has said he would not like to flag his new suit as an MMA money machine like Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
He has attracted the attention of fellow team-mate Conor McGregor and Twitter activist Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media site that he could "easily" defeat Chimaev with a brawl.
It was not a poisoned reply from the warrior cap known as Borz, or úlfur in his native Tetun, who said that he would make Danis with his eyes closed.
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving there at age 19, may not be a man who is proud of his financial status, but he is clearly not proud of his martial arts.

50 people clash in mosques during Eid celebration and no prayers in Eidgah, Karnataka government says
The Karnataka government has issued that only 50 people can gather in mosques for prayers for Eid-ul-Azha, and has banned prayer gatherings on Eidgah and other places due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Ministry of Health's directive states that if more than that number are present, the prayer sessions should be divided.

The U.S. is a hotbed of anti-racism
Two people were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the country last Thursday, with a sedentary form of the virus.
After a sequencing by the Icelandic Genetic Survey, it was revealed that the two individuals who tested positive for the virus and were associated with a new variant of it that has not been detected before in the country.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in the emergency department of the National Medical Council and an emergency room assistant, says that the Icelandic genetic analysis is now reviewing the most likely source of this strain of the virus.
"Yes, this is it, unlike what has been found here before, there is really no chance that this was something to be found here", Kamilla replies.
It is very likely that these individuals have somehow come into contact with a person who is newly arrived from somewhere outside, without even knowing it.
We'll be on the air for the next ten days to monitor it.
Suppose there's a social contamination going on now?
It has not been recently, but it is not excluded because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday.
So we can expect the National Hospital's Department of Virology and Bacteriology to be taking samples in the coming days to try and better map the situation here at home.

Google Pixel 4 can take a picture of the galaxy
The dual optical zoom allows the Pixel 4's optical lens to see in 3D, and thus render a better background mode with facial image mode than in previous Pixel phones, which relied entirely on software to achieve these so-called bokeh effects.
In addition to other camera lenses, the Pixel 4 Soli introduces a "clock flip" feature on the front of the phone that analyzes Motion Sense movements so users can drop a song, turn off the timer, set an alarm on their blink, or turn off the phone's audio by waving their hand.

Rise from the Christmas tree in Laxa, in the Valley
The first hundred-ball was drawn in Lax, in the Valley, this afternoon.
He had placed a skull in Christchurch this morning, and it was 29 inches long.
In the afternoon, he again visited Christmas tree and thought of a story he had heard about the slow catcher who would eat the spider after it had been caught.

The shore fishing protocol allows him to catch up to 1,300 pounds [700 kg] a day, which he finds overwhelming.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to calm down instead of having 48 days over the summer and being able to choose whatever they want.
So the zoning could be changed for me too, and the marine parks that are well located by the fishery should be allowed to enjoy it", says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the saltwater on his coastal paths, but also a few of the eel and some other species float along.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at the Nursery School in Copenhagen.

People are reading Brynjólf's interviews, people are paying their dues and watching what's next on his hair.
Bjartmar, a bicycle dealer, has recovered a bicycle worth millions - now answers for himself after a review of DV
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bicycle-driver" for a while.
DV then pointed to a discussion on Facebook group of Western cities where it was stated that Bjartmar had mentioned the man in Osturvel and said the vespus could be proud.
The original records of the electrician's work revealed only that Bjartmar had identified him as a thief.
Bjartmar said he had received information from a victim of an electrical fault that these were indeed his electrical fault.
I looked for the guy and I checked the shuttle, ending up with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was being searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to leave on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
I usually handle such matters very well, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my words away.
Then the owner of the electric scooter claimed ownership of his electric scooter and set off.
In the year that Bjartmar has devoted to this practice, he says that he can count the times he has been on the verge of people on the fingers of the other hand.
'I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavik,' said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the least respected members of society, drug addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the streets for whatever reason.
'Theft is a tough business and you have to finance the next batch somehow, because unfortunately stealing this kind of cash is an easy way to do that,' says Bjartmar.
"I have had people come to me and help me with what I am doing", he says.
Bjartmar further says that the police have even begun to point people to him for stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the previous news release DV and says that he is not some self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he has not yet reached the top of the ice with his activity, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
She is clearly unbiased on these matters.
He says that he has been so successful at riding a stolen bike that sometimes he finds his "stumbling blocks" on the road that they are just the older bikes they had previously gotten on.
Electric scooters, electric bikes, and electric scooters are heavy, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million dollars.
Bjartmar works part-time at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works at a cooperative.
All these rights were fought for with great effort and determination, but in the end they proved to be a far greater and more lasting victory than the increase in the number of gold coins in the payroll, which disappeared with equal force in the inflationary shock that characterized the postwar period up to 1990, as many remember.
All of this is recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in Icelandic culture, "shadow management".
Since the term is new to the case, it is not expected that it has been defined in a hurry, but the following definition seems to me to be the most widely accepted: Shadow management is when the head of a small company says in the media that he intends to send a representative of the company to the board of a pension fund with a recommendation or instruction on how to take a stand on a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from office at the first opportunity.
If the manager doesn't take it to the media and doesn't talk about the disclosure, it's not "controlled by the imagination" because of course, such interactions between people are always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to decide which way is more appropriate.
The two became friends after Icelandair's CEO Bogi Nils Bogason announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with airlines and flight attendants (to resign), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Association of Merchants, sent them a recommendation to the company's representatives on the board of the Lifeline Fund of Merchants not to support the possible purchase of shares in the company by the fund, or they announced that they would be let go.
Nevertheless, they saw reason to cover the matter in Friday's newspaper, the Bulletin, with big words about shadow government, crime, and the urgent need for legal reform.
There, a small cloud would certainly overturn a heavy cloud, even though the blessed cloud would have been in a state of suspended animation and, moreover, would have been quickly dried up.
Since this is important, let us consider the subject at the end.
These include the need for fund managers to protect the interests of members and to have ethical standards in investing, and these issues are further elaborated in the agreements of both Gildis and the Merchants' Lifeline as I mentioned.
Fortunately, he was able to recover and withdraw his feelings.
Time will tell whether the investing of life-asset funds in the Society can be considered a liability to the benefit of the Society when it is established.
One of the infected had no home-coming fever
He got a negative on a border patrol.
But he is in an Icelandic community and really should go to that resort, says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an emergency department specialist at Landlækni and a substitute emergency doctor during his summer vacation, in an interview with Frétabladet today.
He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the class and if the class is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the later sample.
If the class is not registered, you will have to make your own arrangements to attend the next demonstration.
So it's clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to automate the preaching system even though Icelanders don't register their school numbers.
Fortunately, the person in question is not allowed to enter the country, although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, a permanent Icelander.
The latest one-hour-a-day case was reported in early May, as Spain began lifting one of Europe's strictest curfews.
Others who were sent to the jail are connected to the man in other ways.
However, pictures of the assembly yesterday aroused attention, as one could see in very close association the good performance of his team on the field.
It says: "Parents, please respect the rules that allow contestants to pick up their own toys at school.
The infection is being investigated in that case as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in intensive care due to the infection.
Finally, the report states: "The Public Security Division of the State Police and the Office of the Surgeon General urge people to take precautions and to pay attention to personal protection measures".
If there is even the slightest doubt about the presence of symptoms of the COVID-19 virus, the same person is asked to go for a test at the next health facility.
The station also has a number of other options, including West Buildings Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík.
Judging by the charge to the campground, we can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather doesn't set a trap, but the DV said earlier today of a disappointing forecast.
But we can expect the worst weather south of here, and hope for Patrick's Day.
Whole apartment complex caves down in the best spot in town
Meanwhile, the owners are applying for building permits for the redevelopment, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among others, a video studio, the School Institute, the Milk Shop of the Dairy Association, the Jóa Gun Factory, the fish market and, most recently, the University Printing House.
The house has, so far as words are concerned, remembered its foolish beauty.
Magnús was a supporter of the Borgunar property ownership group and was a defender of the Borgunar property ownership association.
This may be because the owners have waited several years to change the house and the plot.
He also says that he's angry with the owners of the house for not putting in the effort to finish it, find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stop this "lawyer stuff".
The 'lawyer's stage' referred to by the resident is the process of organising the event, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor above and behind the existing apartment building, a new elevator building, and a one-story addition with basement.
The building permit for this project was referred to the Environmental and Resources Committee, which rejected it as not being partly planned and the site survey was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavik then started the district planning work and completed it with an advertisement in Stjórnartíðindum last July.
That scheme was also approved and the Committee repealed it in March 2020.
So by this time, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house were in the early stages.
Still others called the parking lot a rubbish dump, but neighbors have a new unused parking lot in Dunham 1820 under their vehicle.
A memorial to all the phases of the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of work of those who are now in the early stages.
When a reporter approached a park on Dunhagan 18 he was blown off by galloping doors and a garbage chute.
Playstation computers and a new TV were among the other trash on earth - victims of Iceland's summer snow.
The door was opened into the old office of the University Prince, and there were a number of cats of the hippie persuasion to judge.
Clearly, someone has been looking over their shoulder in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and several sheets of geological magazines, which were probably to become books, were blown away.
The Romanians were enjoying a potato salad dinner and invited the reporter in.
The employment of workers has not gone halfway due to the Covid-19 situation, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most skilled in taking advantage of the employment services.
When a reporter asked the boys in Romanian, his coldness suddenly became clear: On the best spot in Reykjavik, a 5,000-square-foot [1,500 sq m] property is in ruins.
In between, the city's planning department is on the front line, the victim of endless appeals and litigation in the planning process, and the interim decisions of the Environmental and Resources Select Committee.
In the fight against obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
Johnson is expected to launch his Better Health campaign tomorrow, Monday, which will encourage doctors to warn their overweight constituents about cycling and will also tackle the growing number of cyclists.
Johnson has had weight problems of his own, but was placed on administrative leave when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is believed to have fallen so severely.
Standing together and being together to lead change.

It's ridiculous, we can change things differently,' said Helga.
In addition, he had previously been disqualified from driving.
The Metropolitan Police had enough of the night, and over 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from 5:00 yesterday to 5:00 this morning.
On Saturday night, 11 noisy murders were reported, and the police diary made a big deal of it.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who drove a bicycle trailer in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The wheels of the trailer were, according to the police log, in "very bad condition" and were stationary.
According to Airbnb, the next free day of the week is Sunday, the weekend of the sale, so it might be a good idea for some holiday shoppers to rush to book the painter's house.
It's been sequenced from the previous domestic outbreak and it's a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think that it's been lurking in the community for some time.
Although the majority of the contamination has been eliminated, further cases of contamination may be possible.
If there are no more people going into isolation from these individuals after being around them at these sports events, then we can say that our precautions at the conventions worked.
The work of the Public Security Department is under constant review.
In a week or so, the population limit is expected to be lowered to 1,000.
This new situation could affect the outcome.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's work, and she usually spends time preparing a good, nutritious meal.
I find it very meditative to be in the kitchen cooking and to get very involved in it.
Top this meal with whatever you have.
Most often it's bananas and jumping mussels & CAFFE.
Example: Incredibly varied, but fruit or vegetables, flatbreads, clean skis with banana and muslin, bread with a topping, and then I could have hummus with a spoon out of the box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often prepare all kinds of nutritious salads from the refrigerator, Chinese or barley, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing, and so forth.
If the organization goes completely off the rails (which happens a lot) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then it's 2 buns with butter, cheese and scrambled eggs, don't put any more on you.
Please bring me a carbohydrate-rich snack for exercise, a loaf of bread, a breakfast cereal, or a fruit.
The electronic voting on the Icelandic Civil Aviation Authority's key agreement on behalf of Icelandair's civil aviation authority will close at noon tomorrow.
No resignations have been withdrawn, this must be laid down so that the machines can be manned.
On 17 July, the board and the board of trustees of the Icelandic Airline Association agreed to announce the general strike of Icelandair, members voted in favour of it.
The agreement never came into effect, but was decided upon following Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the airline, terminate all its flights and seek contracts with another carrier.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the airline has gone too far.
By then Icelandair had dismissed all of its airline and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new core agreement was signed.
Icelandair sent the Cape Town Airport an emergency statement last Wednesday, saying that its revenue for the quarter was about $60 million, or about $1.3 billion.
Asked what that meant and whether it could indicate that a second wave of the pandemic has begun, Mara said that it seems to be a rare occurrence and that it could go away.
However, if there are cases of domestic cases that are not linked to foreign cases and have the same genetic make-up as this particular variant, then the conclusion [of a second wave] could be drawn, but it is untimely to support such a conclusion, explains Már.
BBC news reporters lead the way in an entertaining video that sheds light on the country's pool and hot spring culture.
Relaxed by cell phones, people converse privately at home and in space or tap into the water's power to meditate and recharge the batteries of the mind and body.
On the verge of completing 100 days of elections
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance against the Biden epidemic, pushing underground so-called cultural controversy and promulgating policies that purport to return to law and order.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to be coming down on Republican lawmakers, and the Progressives fear that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been a very successful effort.
He then encouraged the US House of Representatives to read an article by the former New York lieutenant governor, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the US House of Representatives and took Trump up on it.
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars had delayed until then, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be the famous "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through in unison.
Africans have one more year to prepare, and the Japanese government is paying for the delay.
But everyone's got their heads held high.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be magnificent and the aim is to top the last play.
The more spectacular the presentation, the more likely the nose will be to be heard.
The last time the 2020 Olympics were held, $75 million, or about $10 billion, was spent on promotion.
For some professionals, postponing the games is surprisingly welcome.
Australian pentathlete and Olympic gold medalist Chloe Esposito, for example, is castrated and would have been out of shape this summer but hopes to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
For those athletes who were planning to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the Games would in some cases mean that they would retire before the Games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of rigorous exercise.
Few athletes have captured the hearts of audiences at the 2016 Rio Olympics as much as movie star Simone Biles.
Although not generally considered to be a great age, it is higher for a leading lady.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be held or whether they will be held, but we are practicing in the light of their prospects.
She, like many others, is blind to the possibility, or perhaps more likely, the awareness, that the Games will not be held in 2021 at all.
