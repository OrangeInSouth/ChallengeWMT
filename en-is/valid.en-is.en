"For local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community.
If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop." Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."
Gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community, local spread and testing capacity to guide decision-making on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning.
A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is "starting to get iffy," while above 10% is the "threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts."
More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.
Gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues, and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic, steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in March.
McDonald's is among the latest to require face coverings, and the fast food giant joins Walmart, Starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks.
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "Watch this space"
At age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him, particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport, after a campaign in which Zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a Palace side which failed to inspire.
Speaking post-match after the final day, Hodgson told TalkSport's Alex Crook to "watch this space" regarding Zaha's probable exit after acknowledging the forward has "made it clear" he sees his future away from the club.
Hodgson's side wrapped up the campaign with seven straight defeats and a final-day draw, dropping to 14th place in the process.
Zaha himself netted just once between mid-December and the end of the season, a long-range strike in a defeat to Chelsea.
In an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure, Zaha changed agents in January and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away.
Zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the Premier League this season for Palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1,100 minutes or more, pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the No 11.
Hurricane Hanna: Coronavirus-hit Texas faces new threat of catastrophic flooding in 'double whammy'
It came ashore on Saturday as a category one storm (the lowest of the five levels) and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm - but there could still be 15-30cm (6-12in) of rain on Sunday with 60mph winds.
Hanna was the opening hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic cyclone season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield warned residents to stay alert, saying: "We're not even close to over at this point.  We're still expecting catastrophic flooding."
This challenge is complicated and made even more severe, seeing that it's sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19."
Resident Sherry Boehme, who lives along a beach in Corpus Christi, said the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt during the pandemic.

Prince Harry news: Duke of Sussex's friend lashes out at explosive claims in new book
Mr Stott told Sky News that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that the content within the book was no different to that in tabloids other than it was in a hardback.
Mr Stott said: "I think what we are reading here is no different from what we have read in the tabloids it is now just on a hardback."
"I just think it is another sort of attack like the tabloids trying to persecute them."
"But because of who they are they will never get away from that of course."
On Saturday a royal historian also stated that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex supporting the Queen "overshadowed" other members of the Royal Family.
"They have this huge star power."
"They had a small wedding but still the coverage of Harry and Meghan's wedding even though it was smaller was still as big as William's and Kate's because there is a worldwide fascination with them."

The president often shares praise for himself, rants about his rivals and conspiracy theories with his 80 million Twitter followers.

Hunger organization pushes out Yoho after Capitol incident
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Yoho, R-Fla., of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last Monday on the steps of the Capitol.
In an extraordinary speech Thursday in the House, Ocasio-Cortez offered a dramatic account of the incident and broadened her remarks to assail what she called a sexist culture of "accepting violence and violent language against women."
He expressed regret for his "abrupt manner."
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a freshman progressive who has gained praise and criticism for her outspokenness.

"I had a crush on her, one of those youthful crushes that you have," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, lead actress of the series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
When Birna herself was a teenager, at the age when many people begin to develop raging crushes, she did not have the same experience as her peers because she was busy suppressing her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boy bands and young, cool-looking movie heartthrobs, but wasn't interested at all.
She says that people who come out of the closet are often said to experience delayed puberty.
The actress got lucky when she was in New York a few years ago.
One day, the talk turned to how much of a fan of Mariska Birna is.
Birna asked him to pass her on to another crew member, as she had no intention of going anywhere yet.
Surprised, the friend agreed and fetched another crew member.
"He said: Hurry.
She'll go directly to the car with them so you'll have to take the chance and go down to find her trailer.
She didn't find Mariska's trailer anywhere, however, and she began to feel desperate.
None other than Mariska Hargitay was standing there in the trouser suit that she wears on the show and Birna knows quite well — but Birna was so emotional that she could hardly move.
Birna did so, and gathered the courage to poke the actress's shoulder.
The conversation wasn't much longer, as Mariska's car had arrived and the horn honked for her.
Birna said goodbye to her idol, watched the car drive away and then collapsed.
But I was crying because of the release of pent-up tension and the joy.
Then we celebrated with club soda and tequila," says Birna.

In a Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order can't be met.
But Gee also underscored in her order that ICE still has a duty to release children in a timely manner.
The three ways Gee had outlined included releasing families who are in ICE detention together, releasing children to a sponsor, or releasing families based upon a federal court order.
"The bottom line for me is that kids are detained indefinitely and they have no way out unless ICE agrees to do it or families agree to be separated," Fluharty said.
Families are detained in three facilities run by ICE -- Berks in Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.
There are 969 detainees in ICE custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of July 23, according to ICE.

Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's barrister for her Wagatha Christie battle with Rebekah Vardy
After talks between WAGs failed, insiders are expecting dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity barrister acting for Johnny Depp in his blockbuster libel case to represent her in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.
The news comes days after documents submitted to the High Court claimed that Mrs Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, suffered physical and mental anguish as a result of Mrs Rooney's allegations.
As well as representing Depp in his libel action against The Sun over allegations the actor was a wife-beater, Mr Sherborne, 50, is acting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their privacy claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After mediation talks between the two WAGs failed, insiders are now expecting a dramatic courtroom showdown.
"If you thought the Depp trial was box office, don't underestimate this forthcoming WAG war," said a source.
Mrs Rooney claims she then posted a fake story on Instagram, which was later published in a red-top newspaper.
In her legal submission, Mrs Vardy, who has denied involvement, alleges that she was made to feel like a "scapegoat" after Mrs Rooney posted the allegations "in a calculated and deliberate manner that was designed to cause very serious harm and enormous distress."
But Mrs Rooney's team has challenged the claim, alleging that details of her anguish are a "PR exercise" that distracts from the facts.
A source said: "Becky's papers are a sideshow, it is all so spurious."
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown
During his interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump questioned whether the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, could handle the barrage of questioning that Wallace posed to Trump.
"In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter," Wallace said.
The Trump campaign has hit Biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Real Clear Politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.
Trump narrowly won all four states in 2016, flipping them from blue to red as he won the White House.
And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.
The top issues have been the coronavirus and an economy flattened by the pandemic - and the president's performance and record on both issues.
And he's so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful and obviously deep into his powerful connective thinking, because you become aware of this connective thinking that we who have experienced manic episodes know so well."
"Many feel that it restricts the creative element of this unrestrained connective thinking and enormous fiery creative energy that it has, but there are drawbacks of course; frequent pain and lows, dim cellars and darkness."

Delhi Metro Casts First Pier Under Phase-4 Work
The Delhi Metro has reached a major milestone in the Phase-4 work as it cast its first pier on the under-construction Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, officials said on Sunday.
The pier was cast at Keshopur on the elevated stretch between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.
Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.
They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand.
Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run.
Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.
While 21.18 km of this corridor will be elevated, 7.74 km will be underground.
On July 17, the work on the underground section of this corridor was commenced with the beginning of D Wall construction work at the Krishna Park Extension Metro station.
On 24th June, DMRC had started the casting work of u-girders which would be installed on the elevated section of this corridor.
Out of this, 22.35 km will be underground while rest will be elevated.

Troops destroy bandits' camp, eliminate bandits in Zamfara State
The air interdiction missions conducted by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp belonging to the armed gang headed by the bandit leader known as "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest area of Zamfara State.
The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche said the airstrike, which also resulted in the killing of several armed bandits, was executed following Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of confirmatory aerial surveillance missions.
Major General Enenche said the HUMINT established that members of the gang, along with their logistics items, motorcycles and hundreds of rustled livestock, had relocated from their erstwhile position to the new area by a rocky high ground within the Forest.
Enenche said the Air Component, therefore, dispatched an enhanced force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location.
Many others, who were seen trying to flee the location in disarray, were mopped-up in follow-on attacks."
While commending the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, urged them to remain resolute in the conduct of airstrikes against armed bandits.
The Chief of the Air Staff tasked them to continue to provide close air support for the ongoing ground operations in order to eradicate all armed bandits and restore normalcy to the North-West and North-Central zones of the Country.

Congress Was Already Broken.  The Coronavirus Could Make It Worse.
"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis," says the report, which grew out of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership.
It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.
In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true.
Rep. Val Demings talks VP candidacy, blasts Trump for pardons
Congresswoman Val Demings (D-Fla.) was not shy about her willingness to serve as vice president under a potential Joe Biden administration as well as her sincere appreciation for being considered for the role.
In a live interview with BlackPressUSA as part of its #FIYAH!  Live series, the esteemed member of the Congressional Black Caucus shared her history and the work ethic and commitment that has brought her to this point, stating, "You all know my history.  I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor in Jacksonville, Florida."
Demings served as one of seven House Impeachment Managers during the January trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of the Senate acquittal, history will forever note that he is the fourth commander-in-chief to be impeached.
The former House Impeachment Manager, replied in a February interview with NPR from her Capitol Hill office, "Was it worth it?  Every day it has been worth it."
Demings heads Biden's list of potential running mates along with CBC Chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Abrams, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and a few others.
Then, while laughing, she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream, adding, "If y'all want to make a call... go ahead."
There's no doubt that regardless of one's political leanings, history will look back on this period as a season of evolution in American politics and perceptions.
The congresswoman pledged to make sure that the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign advertise and to work with the Black Press of America to get as many as possible out to vote.
Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if defeated, and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself, Demings became animated, "To even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach."

FDNY diversity official says 'most definitely' OK to exclude white firefighter from color guard
An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.
And FDNY's chief diversity and inclusion officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, has defended the decision at a New York state Division of Human Rights trial, The New York Post reports.
According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.
Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.
Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.
During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'
Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'
In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.
'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.
The caravan was grounded and the owner said he would get a means of transport to move it to town.
