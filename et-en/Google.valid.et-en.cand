Corcoron and Ali know a lot about this. They may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey there was not smooth sailing for either of them.
These two, to put it mildly, are bursting with knowledge gained through hardship.
And I'm looking at this list.
The hardest thing to believe in is the moments when you are hit with setbacks.
I earned a good tip then and was happy.
There are two sides here: talent and money.
In the end, I - and my partners - have done very well all these years together with great investors that I never would have had if I hadn't had the guts to find fighting people who like to hustle.
Gratitude for the resurrection, your health, your children, your family.
And I establish what is most important.
I try to come to terms with achieving those most important things.
I scare myself and it makes me work harder.
I see myself entering the ring, the fight taking place, myself winning the belt and returning to the locker room, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake, as I have always done.
However, I always prepare thoroughly. This confidence comes precisely from preparation, because there is a fear in the back of my head that I won't do well, or I won't say the right things, or I won't have the information I need.
How do you pass it on?
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having the attitude that I do - the 'Queen of New York Real Estate' - and crossing the finish line is a long one.
I am sure that in Laila's field as well, it was necessary to decide which are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to stop, how much money you have, what you can invest, what not, how hard you are willing to work.
I try to make those efforts a little more supportive so that these women really feel like, “Okay, now I get it.
Let me try.
Laila Ali: Too much kola.
It keeps me on track.
It helps me get back on track.
They come in all sorts of different shapes.
Stay away from whiners.
Pessimists will destroy a team in any team situation faster than you can blink, because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad too.
They drag good people down with them.
We start many times convinced that now we will take this path.
We do this, this and this.
Do you know what it takes?
Getting things done.
Many are good starters but not very good finishers.
Latvian beer is the brand drink of the new era of fine tuning.
0.5 per million mandatory for state leaders
The ruling class includes not only those politicians who receive a salary from the state for their work, but also those self-conscious ones who do politics voluntarily (read: intentionally): they write opinion flags using the image of Mihkel Mut, they complain on Facebook about how terrible people around them have degenerated here They live in Estonia, picket, boycott, juggle, sabotage.
We have many politicians who know exactly how much a person can drink, who they can sleep with, how many children to have, how to work, how to get paid, when to rest, what to think about, what to eat, how to have fun, when to be sick, how to die .
If anything other than what they said comes back to their public statements, they are enraged, offended, hysterical.
The fact that in several European countries people drive "full head" and this is allowed by law does not sway their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only allowed deviation in any field, but behind zero tolerance is not care, but sheer evil.
Fortunately for them, we have a sizeable bodyguard of brilliantly focused clackers, mentally challenged stuntmen who jump through every window - without feeling pain.
If you believe everything that the self-interested officials, activists and politicians (such are only a small part of all groups, but they can rant so that the whole society is deafened) say and write, the citizen is not only disgusting, vulgar and unpleasant, but also brainless, without brain.
But let's not believe, do not force to tolerate, do not forbid drinking.
An Estonian person does not change his behavior two months before the elections, in order to turn his back on his popularity diet after achieving the goal and to not only inhale, but also expel from his mouth what quickly restores unpleasant brain fat kilos.
In order to teach, you don't have to fine, restrict, forbid, force, call to order, put in a corner, throw rotten eggs in the media shaming post all the time.
A speeding policeman gives me a speeding ticket on my free time?
Force to exceed the speed only in public - the cars of the rulers, also private cars, let them all be red.
Or we learn that we ourselves want to be ruled by the most hardened ones.
In reality, the process is longer, and during this entire time, the hot food does not steam, because the steam comes from the high water content, which, for example, bread products do not have.
In the immediate vicinity of the heat, they steam much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly prepared appearance.
For example, instead of a cake with a creamy filling or an ice cream that looks like ice, it can be mashed potatoes instead.
Glue replaces milk.
Since, for example, breakfast cereals or muesli must look crunchy and tasty in milk, glue is used instead of milk, through which no flakes fall through.
Often, however, it is fried in a ready-made pan or made in the oven, and stripes imitating grilling are drawn on the meat with shoe wax.
So instead, it can be on top of a cake or berries or in a milkshake in an ad.
That's why the burger doesn't look like the advertisement on the table.
To add a full impression, the chicken is stuffed with paper, if necessary, it is polished with the aforementioned mashed potatoes, and then the chicken is simply sprayed with brown paint.
In fact, the cakes quickly absorb the syrup, and the flowing stream of syrup quickly disappears from the photographer's eyes.
However, mink cubs can be named until the day of re-independence.
And although father Kigoma occasionally runs around puffing and rattling fence posts with his horn, mother Kibibi does not let himself be disturbed, while the rhino calf learns valuable lessons.
The running time began for takinis, narrow-legged animals with a peculiar appearance.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the fence posts of the large outdoor enclosure of the mother elephants and the viewing terrace of the father elephant.
In order not to disturb the colorists, the mother elephants Fien and Draay again spent time in the company of the father elephant Carl.
You can buy mugs with rhinos and minks and other great souvenirs from the zoo.
"In general, fructose and glucose in a flavored milk product with a normal 3-4% fruit content are about 0.3 grams, and especially in berry products with a fruit content of about 15% up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams," said Kalbin.
For example, if a solo traveler can spend 51 euros in a single room at Värska Spa in the water center building with buffet dinner and breakfast and unlimited use of the water park, gym and saunas, then visiting the Pädaste manor in Muhumaa with a partner will cost 287 euros for one person.
For example, only suites are left in Hedon Spa and Strand Spa and the conference hotel in Pärnu on August 11, and the Vihula manor operating in Lahemaa is also sold out.
In that case, it is worth checking before buying a package, and at the same time there is not a major event nearby, because this immediately raises the prices to the ceiling.
Of course, it was my own fault that I missed this vacation.
It's my own fault that the stupid sense of duty in my chest spread.
That's how it was - the new job I started in March of the same year required a lot of work, but something about this job suited me so much better that I recovered to a completely new life in three months, I rested myself.
"That's what Christmas and New Year's are for!" now some decent citizen exclaims angrily.
Yes, I do a lot of work living a vacation-free life, maybe more than I would in some freaking slaughterhouse, and I'm pretty rested all the time.
Most of the time before Christmas I've been running like a squirrel on a wheel - presents, at least four Christmas parties, a little more work load...
But a desperate and tired person cannot make good decisions, let alone perfect them into a plan.
If you don't force yourself to scramble like a calf that escaped the barn during the holidays, a couple of weeks will be enough to find some hook in your life that deserves to be straightened out and figure out exactly how to do it.
I consider it important to live as much as possible so that I don't need a vacation, that I take a regular vacation, not once a year.
Unbeknownst to them, many Estonians already have the desired Thursday working week.
According to the prestigious management magazine Harvard Business Review, employees spend almost 1.5 hours a day in an office without walls, or almost an entire working day a week.
1.5 hours taken from working time, instead of recovery time spent with family and hobbies or vacations, is furnished with concentration difficulties, interference with work, increasing irritation and anxiety, and the fading of the will to work.
That's how a distressed seagull, defying the wind and trying to fly, caught the camera of Õhtulehet's photographer.
Hartman thinks they freaked out because they don't know how to treat someone with a disability - Morgan has the cognitive understanding of a five-year-old and also a form of autism.
This incident haunted him.
Meeting him always brings a smile to your face and he's sure to want a hug.
But there have been many times where we haven't been able to take him to different places," he says.
"When we opened, he didn't dare go to it.
"At first he just stood near it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
Morgan, now 23, keeps getting better at things.
The Estonian U18 age group basketball team defeated Poland 68:63 in the quarter-finals of the European Championship B division at home, according to head coach Vaido Rego, it was a real play-off match.
The game was brittle.
The play-off can be a game of one or two shots", argued Rego.

"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk uphill, that there is no point in pushing yourself to run, because there are such climbs here and it doesn't really matter if you run or do a fast walk," says the actor, who took the triathlete instructor's advice to heart.
At the same time, he was able to catch his breath while walking, and therefore, even after crossing the finish line, he was able to give interviews left and right without being out of breath.
As if 1.9 kilometers of swimming, 90 kilometers of cycling and 21.1 kilometers of running were not behind.
I thought that everything would be fine if I'm not on my face after the Ironman". Contrary to the playful, face-down state, Raivo offered a completely different picture when he crossed the finish line: hands raised to the sky in victory and sincere joy of victory shining on his face.

We are like cattle without an owner.
"There have also been some handling of large quantities of narcotic substances, but we will make summaries when the Weekend is over", says Sinimeri.
By the way, Sinimeri says that if it rains suddenly and horizontally from the sky, they don't have much work to do.
The Pärnu police have also set up a headquarters in the Weekend area, where you can take found things, and from there you can also claim your lost things.

The plane drew a perfect picture of itself over the US
The aircraft's real-time flight path data indicated that it was not just a straight line or an arc, but a series of flight paths that, when connected together, formed an image of the aircraft.
Seen on a map, the plane's strange route depicts a twin-engine airliner.
Apparently there weren't many shoppers from Estonia among them, because it is said that our parents are left completely cold by the hilbuses of the royal children.

Big, wet eyes, surrounded by a thick black line in his gaunt, pale face, gave him the impression of a wounded animal.
In public, she could wear a thick layer of makeup.
She apologised, saying that her skin must be glowing as if she were being caressed by the sun, because if she went out 'normally', the tabloid photographers would snap her and then all accuse her of looking 'pale', 'dull' and 'tired'.
It was for this reason that Diana went to the solarium three times a week, using a machine in her home.
Probably one of the biggest mistakes the Royal Family made was thinking that if they approved her as Charles's wife, they would get a beautiful little broodmare with nothing but cotton candy for a brain.
He may not have been the best in his class at school, but when it came to creating an image, he was a top five student.

Racing down the Loggers Leap attraction in Thorpe Park in 1993 with her two young sons, she was drenched and laughing heartily, mascara streaked under her eyes like any other mother spending the day with her children.
Or in later years, walking out of the gym, hair slicked back, fit legs in cycling shorts, face flushed from exercise, health and vitality exuding from every pore.
Her brows are too oppressive and she has too much boring brown applied to her eyes.
Anna Harvey recalls: "One time, when the newspapers reported that she had undergone cosmetic surgery on her nose, she turned to me and said with a laugh: 'Honestly, if I had had my nose operated on, do you think I would have chosen this one?'"
One of her most memorable public appearances - at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1994, where she wore the famous "revenge dress", a provocative, bare-shouldered, figure-emphasizing piece by Christina Stambolian - indicates that her signature style of the later years of her life was beginning to emerge.
With her hair short and swept behind her ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her short hairstyle in stark contrast to a very provocative black silk dress.
It's a real shame that he didn't get to prove it to himself.
Southwest Japan is preparing for the arrival of Typhoon Noru
A representative of the Meteorological Agency said Noru, which means a type of deer in Korean, would then likely turn north and pelt Kyushu with rain, although northern parts of the island, hit by torrential rains and floods last month that killed 36 people and left four missing, were likely to escape the worst. .
The representative added that depending on the change in course, Noru could move directly across Kyushu and then along the Japanese island of Honshu, but the longer-term path remains difficult to determine.
There are places on the landscape that, even with the best of intentions, simply cannot be reached with conventional vehicles.
Already in 1956, the M-274, which became known as the mechanical mule, rolled out of the Willys Overland factories - a further development of the vehicle designed in the final years of World War II, designed to evacuate the wounded.
To be honest, it's a bit strange to call it an improvement over a mechanical mule.
It is hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering wheel: everything, all luxury.
It was as if the too-fast constructors had too quickly put the drawings on the engineer's desk and started production in a hurry.
But in war, passability is much more important than comfort.
In this category, the mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam had no rival.
The light machine, weighing less than five hundred kilograms, easily managed to get to those places where the Willys Jeep, which has gained mythological fame with its super-crossing ability, had to show its brake lights in surrender.
Vehicles with a carrying capacity of nearly 500 kilos were mostly used for transport work, both for transporting ammunition and livestock.
However, if such a truck came under fire, and it still happened, the driver was able to move the steering system forward in the last resort and lower it so much that it was possible to steer the vehicle lying on its stomach.
Mules were produced until 1970, with a total of 11,240 produced, and were in service with the army until 1980, when they were replaced by the successful HMMWVs.
They came back into the picture after the Twin Towers fell to dust in New York and US soldiers found themselves hunkered down in the desert landscapes of Iraq and Afghanistan.
Brands donning camouflage include names such as Kawasaki's Mule, Honda's Rancher and Foreman, Yamaha's Rhino and Arctic Cat, and an ever-expanding range of models from leading military ATV manufacturer Polaris.
In the case of the MV700, it is a military version of their Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman made for civilian use, with winches added to the front and rear, a two-piece fuel tank for longer distances, a reinforced frame and bottom, and some other military equipment that farmers or those who just like to hunt in the woods don't have much to do with.
The changeable shape of the box in the back, the sides of which are removable, allows you to travel from point A to point B with luggage that is bigger than this small but stubborn insect.
In fact, M-Gators already received crossfire in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where medical teams used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the burden on soldiers moving on their own feet by carrying stuff that would otherwise have had to be carried on their backs.
And it is clear that in circumstances where defense spending is being broadly reduced and small-scale, target-oriented whizzing is practiced instead of large-scale conventional warfare, lightweight and fast small vehicles have joined the army in order to stay in service.
The department's blunder resulted in the release of sensitive data on vulnerable children in care

"Without a doubt, I want to go out as an Olympic champion," he says, not afraid to specify the goal.
To be honest, I have also had such an experience, indeed for 40 days, where I decided to live the life of a "crowd" in the south of France, just to be free and live one day at a time.
The other week I joined a French "homeless", a 44 year old man was..
He doesn't drink alcohol, he doesn't do bad things, in a word - a decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicator, seen life..
In a word - I joined him and for the next 3 weeks we wandered together, from city to city and about 5€ per day for food.
The money still came, as long as you don't live.
The man taught how to offer help in the evenings on the terraces of closed hotels and restaurants and on farms along the way.

The fourth Estonian person received a heart in Finland.
According to doctors, the world has now lived with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years.
All he has left is a scar and immune-suppressing herbs.
In addition, the cardiac surgeon pointed out that getting off extracorporeal circulation was a difficult part of the operation.
Rather, according to him, heart transplantation can be considered rare, because Estonians need it the least.
There is still excitement with a rare cut, but we have practiced this work for many years.
According to Taali, the heart was given to the patient because the organ was not suitable for any other patients living in the country belonging to the Scandiatransplant association.

Up until now, we have said the Center Party and meant the Clay Island or vice versa.
Based on political practice and ideology so far, it can be said that the old rhinoceros is definitely playing them.
For the center party, the card of the People's Front and the insulted poor has also disappeared.
The first of them is worthless without its creator, and the coalition partners in the government prevent the second from playing more forcefully.
If any political party should have the idea to breathe life into a well-functioning opposition, the Center Party's deck of cards is again missing one trump card.
I restarted the machine.
"With two small children next to me, this dirty laundry immediately arises", the woman muses.
Since no one in the family knows of a man or woman with that name who could be married to a Tom, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin asked the older child that maybe he had found the ring outside, put it in his pocket, and the ring had ended up in the washing machine, but the child confirmed that he had not brought the ring home.
Since the pace of life with two small children is quite fast, the find was initially forgotten in the cupboard at home.
"Recently, there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed like it was high time to also look for the owner of the ring you found", Karin refers to the case circulating on social media, where the wedding ring found on Puhangu Street in Tallinn last week happily found its owner.
Then there was a feeling that this nonsense was needed now.
The commentators also proposed the idea that maybe the ring has reached the woman in the pocket of the second round of clothes.
"Well, the last time, somewhere around six months ago, some second-round pants were bought for going to work, which flew into the washing machine without a thorough examination, but really?" she reasons to herself.
Karin has also turned to the civil status office to get help in finding the owner.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (pictured) on her Facebook page and in the group "Noticed in Tallinn", shared information with the North Tallinn district and the North prefecture.
But the visitors have not been shy about sharing great things either.
This confusion is evidenced by Cricket Australia's (CA's) agonizing delays in reaching a pay deal with players, the Australian Rugby Union's (ARU) indecisiveness in sacking the team, an uprising by Football Federation Australia (FFA) stakeholders, rugby league's difficulties in assembling a functioning independent commission, and the Australian Football League's (AFL) relentless efforts to be a public advocate of social justice. flag bearer.
Conversely, the failure of the ARU's inept boss, former NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne, to field an Australian Super Rugby team has pushed the league back to its roots.
However, the pendulum swung too far to the business side, and the league's fans have been looking ever since for a savior - someone with a distinguished past in the sport.
