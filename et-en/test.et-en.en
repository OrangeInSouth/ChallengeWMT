Another thing that underscores the special nature of the craft is that to go out to sea, the Nacra F20 FCS needs an auxiliary boat next to it and at least two crew members.
The maximum is three, so there isn’t a lot of leeway.
It starts to dawn on me why this isn’t just a Sunday cruiser.

In the past, outlets and culverts were reinforced with precast concrete panels (of the MP or land improvement and the VKP or hydro construction variety) and sod.
Often cat-tails are planted on the bottoms of the new settling ponds or basins or they start to grow spontaneously from airborne seed.
The pond in the picture was dug last year and this year the soil at one end of the pond was levelled off, and a well for abstraction of firefighting was established using concrete ring installations.
To keep an errant vehicle from speeding into the pond, some larger chunks of rock were also transported to line the lot.
A court had issued for the arrest of Gulevich in Spain.
For example the latest court decisions, the eight accused to be tried separately from the so-called Dikajev crime organization criminal case, from whom 80,000 euros was confiscated, or the court decision with regard to nine persons accusing Igor Aleynikov of establishing in 2006 a crime organization engaged in illegal trade in contraband cigarettes and commission of crimes related to human smuggling in Ida-Viru County and southern Estonia.
The latter condition is the origin of the popular name for hepatitis in Estonian, kollatõbi or yellow disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis C are: refraining from sharing personal hygiene and manicure accessories, other objects with blades and syringes and needles, refraining from tattooing and piercing; and using a condom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual abstinence.
Without breaking stride, Farah brought his wife Tania and his children on to the track with him after he finished.
In London, Farah is eyeing a double victory in the 5000 and 10000 metres for a fifth championship in a row.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O’Connor’s Lady in Gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, delves a good bit deeper into the late 19th and early 20th century history of Vienna cultural life.
But it delves even deeper into history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information could have benefited from less sparing cuts, and a narrower focus would have allowed the portrait promised in the heading to shine more.
The fact that in the case of some portraits, the master was suspected of having an affair with the model didn’t deter the magnate.
Let it be noted here that while Kiss can be seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, a trip to New York’s Neue Galerie is required to see the depiction of Adele Bloch-Bauer in Lady in Gold.
The Bauer family tree reproduced at the start of the book made it significantly easier to orientate with regard to the events.
In the preliminary heat, Gold was very close to her personal record in the 200 m backstroke, with a time of 2:16.62.
Gold got the last, 10th berth in the A final.
At the adult championships of Canada, the young future hopeful will also start in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m medleys.
Only the record-setting Estonian Elina Partõka has swum the distance faster than Gold.
She also set a person best in the 100 m backstroke relay, with a time of 1.03.69 as the starting swimmer.
In the event twice that distance, she only managed seventh, with a time of 2.17.31 in the final.
As Trump is one of the presidents who has taken the most days of holiday, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
By the way, Trump in his 196 days in office has not taken the most vacation time of any president.

She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.

Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."

The pounding music heard from the beach doesn’t keep Laine up at night.
Living in the city centre, she heard music coming from the beach, but now the walls of her home are out of range of the music.
The festivalgoers’ revelry doesn’t faze the woman.
But partying on the beach, she says, is a common thing for residents of the “summer capital”.
The revelry and carousing hasn’t turned his life upside down.
We have to think about how the international relations could be better.
Loud music doesn’t get his spirits down.
“They hit the bottle pretty hard, of course, but kids will be kids and Lord, let it be, be decent and we’ll get by,” he says.
The people living in the beach area go somewhere else for that time, to visit friends or family.
The festival music doesn’t bother her family’s slumber, even though last year it was heard a bit further than this year.
We actually live outside the city, and it can be heard quite well way over by the Pärnu River,” she says.
There will be scattered showers with a chance of thunderstorms.

You’re sure to be on some of them, look for yourself!
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
I'm small for 140.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
“If we look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have settled, Ida-Viru County comes right after Harju County,” she added and noted that 40 per cent of them are married to EU citizens.
The new residence permit has probably resulted in decreased extensions of old residence permits.
In their case as well, the rule is that where a community has taken shape ahead of them, others arrive more easily,” added Rammus.
Nevertheless, history is a bottomless well of ideas for Maria Tammeoru – old paintings and costumes: “I can sit in some museum for hours lost in reverie, just admiring old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
I have a girlfriend whose entire sauna is full of my haute couture dresses.
Maria doesn’t also accept the fashion custom that fashion designs have to be presented by a twiggy supermodel; she is happy to bring ordinary women on to the catwalk.
I wouldn’t have the nerve to just watch calmly from the audience.
It isn’t restricted to design, stylistics, logistics, managing, organizing – a temperamental woman’s day has to have room for all of it.
Fanatics do rack up an incredible amount of work hours.
The lavish tulle frills that made Maria’s talent an overnight sensation, have remained the signature of Mammu Couture right up to the present.
The first thing I noticed is that we didn’t get rebounds.
And when there’s such a big difference in rebounding, there’s nothing to be done,” commented BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp, the only Estonian to have played in the NBA, in commenting on the Estonian U18 boys’ team’s 75-61 loss to Great Britain.
The opponents grabbed 28 offensive rebounds and got more scoring chances because of that.
We weren’t ready for their aggressive defence or offence.
They were able to get a hand in the way everywhere while on defence, and our playmaking was hampered.
That knocked us off our feet.
Müürsepp said Estonia should have committed more fouls to nip the opponents’ momentum in the bud.
In the last quarter as well, we had zero fouls but the opponents had already scored a number of quick baskets.
Today we were powerless against their aggressive play.
Müürsepp said he was satisfied with his charge on the Kalev squad, Matthias Tass.
At the tournament, generally good words can be said about the whole team, to this point we were a united strike force.
Not only the young men’s European championship division B basketball tournament is underway in U18 age class in Tallinn; the young women started yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia’s game with Poland tended unfortunately to be in the anti-record category.
The Estonians made two of the first four field goal attempts in two minutes, from there on, they missed 25 in a row, then a three-pointer went in, and then another 21 missed attempts…
By the end of the game, Poland was shooting 33% from the field; and Estonia, 13% (9 out of 68).
The Latvian naval auxiliary LVNS Virsaitis has been made the flagship of the group, and the group’s command staff also is based on board.
Risto Joost: Listeners will hear opera classics La Traviata and Tosca, see ballet performances from Bolero to “Karlsson” and there’s even an in-production in the programme, which this time will be a performance of Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratorio The Seasons by the same international creative team that brought another Haydn masterpiece to the stage at Pirita in 2015, The Creation.
It’s “Karlsson Flies”.
The Karlsson-on-the-Roof character had been dwelling in his soul since he was a child, it appears.
Risto, how do you find the energy for everything?
Especially this week, with the most important rehearsals, I have been avidly practising it and works.
Sure – you have to change into more comfortable clothing.
Your Tango provides nine signs that show that your partner is remorseful and you could forgive them.

Orel confirmed that she was satisfied with her World Championships debut and that many good competitions lay ahead for her: “I came here with the 32nd or last place result, and I finished in 18th place.

Urmet, working in the medicine tent at Weekend, told Õhtuleht yesterday that they have had to dispense quite a few bandages.
Blisters and abrasions are the main ones, sprains and mild falls.

Roofs were already flying off the houses yonder, recalled an older woman, Linda Kurova of Haapsalu, in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002.
But why try to support trees with your arms, what power do you have against such a storm?
Locals said trees behind Paralepa were bowed over so that they were touching the ground, some were completely felled, some snapped in two.
Everything looked really horrible, the storm had ravaged the beautiful old trees much as a war might have done.
In the Merivälja part of Tallinn, on 6 August, one tiny slip of a girl was said to have shouted: “Mother, mother!

It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."

As the film wears on, the less of the House-of-Cards element there is and the moralistic intentions of the film-makers start becoming more evident.
On walks to the Chicago’s towering buildings, his son, who dreams of an architect’s profession, makes his father think about what really matters, like faith, goodness, love…even the Twin Towers attack is not neglected.
Now I have a bet I make with myself – if a film has a happy ending, I reward myself with a coffee after the movie, but if I’m wrong, then at least the screenwriter can be praised for a surprise.
For a second, it seems I will go coffee-less – when his spouse calls Dane from the hospital and he runs toward the hospital room down the hallway in slow motion.
It’s a feel-good moment for me, too – I’m getting pretty good at predicting the endings of American dramas!
The film will no doubt do well at the box office.
Foreign street musicians in Tallinn not itching to obtain busking permit.
Many foreigners busk in the city centre of Tallinn.
The ones Õhtuleht spoke to said admitted they were busking in the Old Town without the city government permit.
The third man next to them was sitting on a backpack and calmly smoking a hand-rolled cigarette.
Noemi, the one playing the accordion, and Bob the juggler said that they busked for fun as well as for the money.
When we found ourselves by the Viru gates once again about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women had approached the musicians and were telling them to move along.

Culture Minister Indrek Saar is one of the attendees at the Weekend Festival and says he is glad that true world headliners are playing in Estonia.
In response to the question of why the weekend festival is so important for Estonians, he said that the question should be asked of all those who are enjoying every aspect of the festival for three days in a row.
All of us have taken a spin on the dance floor to his record spinning,” he says.
Naturally, our own Estonian acts, too – starting with NOËP to a wide range of others.

At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.

"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
After a party with lots of drinking, a certain tougher breed of people find themselves thinking the hair of the dog that bit them might be a good idea.
But this is just putting off the inevitable and is quite a blow to one’s health.
Before and after alcohol, after the big party in the morning…or even instead of alcohol.
The stomach lining is often irritated after tippling, so still water or lightly carbonated water is especially good.
Certainly it wouldn’t be wise to go split wood at grandma’s – that could be a fateful miscue.
If you’re already experiencing nausea because of yesterday’s overindulgence, it isn’t a good idea to burden your liver with a big fatty meal.
If your health is doing poorly around lunch, try some bouillon for example.

This diuretic will rob your body of the last liquid.
Don’t count on pain relievers.

Slightly under half of respondents in the Czech Republic and Poland thought the same.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
The Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition conceived as revenge against the Centre Party, the Meie Tallinn coalition founded by Reform Party outcast Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE outcast Maria Kaljuste, and the Tegus Tallinn coalition of businessmen hoping to show party members their place – it appears that there will be just as many election coalitions, created at the initiative of those who have got their fingers burned in partisan politics, participating in this year’s local elections as there will be political parties.
But the chickens will be counted in the autumn and the key question will be whether there will be enough disillusioned voters for them all.
Who will stick with Savisaar?
The dwindling of his base can be seen in the events organized for the owner of his election coalition.
And might the reason that some of Savisaar’s loyal adherents are refraining from running as candidates in Tallinn be found in the fact that the so-called “Savisaar list” led by the corrupt and those suspected of corruption crimes is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government with a Russian language pop song, featuring an appearance by the Lasnamäe district’s mayor; and a very primitive computer game in which the main character Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to ride a bike down a street avoiding puddles and squirrels along his way – is that how the Centre Party will try to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-olds allowed to vote for the first time?
If one doesn’t want to partake of the revelry oneself, instead of getting hung up about it, it would be worth going off to discover Estonia – and rent out a bed to a festivalgoer for a small fortune.
The archaic culture of the Siberian settlers, which still survives, is starting to have an effect on the settlers back at home too, because it’s just so amazing, says Mare Piho, who has studied the distant Setos most thoroughly.
I arrived at this number based on stories told by Siberian Seto men who have also thought about this.
All that had to be cultivated and managed in some way.
It was common for families to have seven or eight children.
How much did Siberian Seto culture differ from that of the motherland Setos?
They made them as well, but they always drew a distinction between what they brought with them and what they had made on the spot.
It seems to me that Setomaa starting to “feed back” there, it’s starting to influence them.
The Valgejõgi river flowing through the city has a little island where Tapa residents traditionally celebrate St. John’s Eve.
I have walked there with a girlfriend on occasion.
Along with everything else, opera soloist Tamm has practised his arias between the three bridges on the riverbanks: “Since the place is on the outskirts of the town, I won’t necessarily encounter anyone when I’m humming my tunes.”
“There’s an amazing view of Tapa from Männikumägi hill, but there’s also recreational trails for running or skiing in winter, and, say, play disc golf – the disc golf course has been established, and the discs can be rented from the sports centre,” says Reigo.
Colleague Rasmus Kull will probably have to be to be invited to Tapa as he is an experienced disc golf player and has his own discs.
Maybe he will lend them to me!
Even though this year’s theatre season just ended with Aleksei Karenin, on 11 August, Elluärkamine (Coming Back to Life) will be performed on 11 August at the railway station, when it will be the 1980s again in the old station building.
“The Tapa city festival will be held 11-13 August, and pop-up cafés will open up in the statin building and there will be many cultural events, including a rally race open to the public,” says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old town on those days.
Wolves teaching pups preying on sheep.
After a year’s respite, Hiiumaa farmers’ flocks are serving as “training material” again – wolves thought to be teaching their young to hunt have killed a number of sheep already.
The Environmental Agency’s statistics – that no wolf litters were born last year in Hiiumaa – and the information from the Hiiumaa hunting board that two litters have been recorded this year – are consistent with the attacks.
Late on Sunday night, wolves killed 15 sheep in Kabuna Village in Emmaste Rural Municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Also under the amendment, GM crop handlers have the obligation to have a pre-existing agreement with a person engaged in apiculture within a specified radius will be amended.

The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.

A GSM transmitter was attached to the leg of the latest young common crane on 1 August, this time on Muhu Island.
According to bird watcher Mati Martinson, who lives on Sõrve peninsula, the first young crane to get a transmitter was tagged in Sõrve, and this brood is already flying around, has left the nest area and joined the large population roosting on Mullutu-Suurlaht bay.
This Tuesday, relatively late for this round of tagging cranes, another young crane got a transmitter, this one on Muhu Island.
Last year one crane named Mati got a GSM radio tag in Türju on Sõrve peninsula.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Right before that, she had fouled out of the long jump at a tournament in China.
The 2012 European championships in Helsinki were marred by an injury sustained in the javelin throw, but in her debut Olympics in London, she got 23rd with 6013 points.
Šadeiko ran the hardest gauntlet last year when she didn’t get a result in the long jump at the Amsterdam European championships
I’d just like to have a decent performance at the heptathlon or similar events.
She had to take time off – whether to continue in the heptathlon at all?
I achieved mental clarity
“I knew that it wasn’t time to pack up and retire,” says Šadeiko about her self-cleansing.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was hard to watch her charge suffering, but she knew that above all, the athlete had to get clear herself on what she wanted.
She has been put down so much by everyone.
The heptathlete then realized that it was still far from her best; it only slaked her initial thirst for competing.
She knows her own body and trusts her intuition.
New arrivals in families of friends and relatives bring cheer
Šadeiko is also riding high on happy events in the lives of people close to her.
Both her former training partners Maris Mägi and her sister Grete recently became new mothers, and the heptathlete draws support from the new additions to their families.
A type of alcohol that gives your brain a “workout”
“There’s more to it than that,” he says.
A total of 8,577 positions were examined.
There’s always too little time for shared activities, but working out with the rug rats is a good way to combine shared time, play, closeness and physical exertion.
And what a convenient solution – no matter where go in the summer, you always have the living dumbbells with you, impatiently reminding you with their little voices: “Let’s work out now!”
Squats are the foundation of keeping legs and glutes in shape – who wants to take on the shape of a wave-smoothed sand castle over the summer?
It’s amazing to use children instead of weightlifting equipment!
More advanced lifters can also do squats with pretty big kids.
For the kid, it’s balance training, they count the repetitions, and it’s fun to be able to sit high and mighty.
Bigger children can also do squats at the same time.
Establish the range of movement by touching the ground and stretching your arms up.
Pretend-plank: form a long plank column through which to take turns crawling through.
It’s actually harder than the ordinary version, but much more fun, as you can high-five your friend from time to time.
To add resistance, you can stay in the plank position, the little one on your back, and walk around in that position as well.
For extra difficulty, you can put a smaller kid piggy-back on your hips, but this exercise is fun for all kids.
While you’re at it, scurrying on the sand, your triceps, glutes and abs will get a workout in no time flat.
Your kid will descend to your legs so that his or her body weight will be evenly spread out to the front and back.
Your tyke can fly, have fun, practice balance and serve as a resistance weight.
Life for the little coach is especially jolly when he gets a little kiss at the top of each movement.
Stretching out your legs adds resistance.
The kids themselves will find it much more fun to train abs in tandem and by clapping.
Arm action and pulsating squats
Ott (10), Säde (8) and Õnne (4) served as the exercise equipment.
From the Philippines to the wide world – straw bags journey into the hearts of fashion fans
Bags woven of straw are a summer classic that in recent years has become a hit product in its own right, which is de rigueur to hang on an arm for anyone properly enjoying the summer. Despite its humble origins, merchants have managed to tack on a price befitting a hit.
You just had it and if you didn’t, there was nothing wrong.
It’s far from just a beach bag, but just as popular as a purse for urban settings, and bolder women even walk into the office carrying them.
Yet it would be wise to be certain whether such a summery style is all right with your boss or whether it would be good to stick your day-planner and laptop into a bit more official-looking case.
The amount of variety has made straw bags a real summer fling for women.
For example, reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that catches the eye is that the first thing fashion connoisseurs do when they’re travelling on holiday abroad is rush to the local market as the first thing and buy a straw bag they are loyal to the entire holiday and which accompanies them to the beach, marketplace and while hanging out on the town with girlfriends.
It is worth mentioning that demand for the bags is so high among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably have to resort to violence to become the owner of a bag.
No doubt so that wealthier customers don’t have to feel that they are mere mortals promenading around with some cheap bags.
Chanel’s version of the straw bag will set you back about 6,000 euros.
Namely, the straw bags originate in the distant Philippines, from which they spread to the wide world.
Straw bags owe a thank you note above all to actress Jane Birkin, as a bigger fan of straw bags has yet to be seen.
