Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman.
To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.
And I check that list.
If only you could believe that when you're getting hit, which is the hard part.
I made great tips and I was happy then.
There's two pieces to it: talent and money.
So I wound up doing very well, as did my partners, over all the years with these great investors that I would have never had if I hadn't had the confidence to get some scrappy person who really wanted to hustle.
Gratitude for waking up, for my health, for my kids, for my family.
And I put down what my A's are.
And I try to be okay with just accomplishing the A's.
I scare the living daylights out of myself and that gets me running hard.
Going into the ring, seeing the fight happen, seeing me winning that belt, seeing me back in my dressing room celebrating with a slice of cake, which I always had.
I do prepare though; that confidence comes from preparation, because that fear is in the back of your head of not doing well, of not saying the right thing or having the right information.
How are you paying it forward?
Barbara Corcoran: There's a long distance between being inspired and having a view like I did, "The queen of New York real estate," and actually running it over to the finish line.
I'm sure in Laila's field, you had to judge the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to stop, how much money you had, what you could enter, what you couldn't enter, how hard you wanted to work.
And I think I'm going to try to put a little flesh on the aspiration, for these women to really feel like, "Okay, I got it now.
Let me run.
Laila Ali: Too much junk.
It keeps you on the straight and narrow.
Gets me straightened out again.
Naysayers come in all different forms.
Steer clear of complainers.
Naysayers in any kind of a team situation will ruin the team faster than you could blink an eye because people who are at a pity party need other people to feel sorry with.
They suck other good people down.
So many times, we're like, "We're going to be on the straight and narrow.
We're going to do X, Y and Z."
You know what being consistent takes?
It takes finishing.
So many people are good at starts and not so good at finishing.
Latvian beer is the emblematic beverage of our new era of making fine adjustments.
BAC of 0.05% obligatory for government officials
The ruling class doesn’t include only the politicians who are paid salary by the state, but also the self-aware people who engage in politics voluntarily (read: intentionally), wrote opinion provocations after the example of Mihkel Mutt, curse out their peers on Facebook as to how awful people around them here in degenerate Estonia live, picket, boycott, juggle, and sabotage.
We have very many politicians who know exactly How much a person should drink, whom they should sleep with, how many children they should spawn, how much money to make, went to go on vacation, what to think about, what to eat, how to entertain themselves, when to be sick, when to die.
If they’re public comments are met by anything other than what they themselves sad, they are furious, insulted, offended hysterical.
The fact that in a number of European countries, people drive around in a car, head full of booze, and this is legal, doesn’t shake their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only allowed deviant behaviour in every municipality, but it’s not compassion and care that is behind zero tolerance, but rather outright evil.
Luckily for them, we have a big enough bunch of claqueurs, stunt men with a deficit of spirit who leap through every window – without feeling any pain.
If we believed everything that the selfless officials, activists and politicians (such people make up only a small part of all groups, but they are able to shout so loud so that the whole society becomes deaf), talk and write that citizens are not only nasty, vulgar and unpleasant but also mindless, with no brains.
But don’t believe them, don’t force them to tolerate it, don’t prohibit drinking.
Estonian people won’t change their behaviour two months before the elections so that after the aim is achieved they can turn their back on their fad diet and yet again let in and also out of their mouth whatever quickly puts on the pounds in the form of fat on their brain.
To teach, it isn’t necessary to mete out fines, lay siege to, prohibit, coerce, call to order, make stand in a corner, hurl rotten eggs at people while they’re in the media stockade.
A policeman who speeds when he’s off duty is fining me for speeding?
To force them to exceed the speed limit only publicly – let the rulers’ cars, and private cars, too, all be red.
Or will we learn that we ourselves want the most debased to govern us.
In actuality, the shot is longer and the hot food doesn’t give off steam the whole time, as the steam comes from the high moisture content, which bread products for example don’t have.
When exposed directly to heat, they steam longer than a burger or popcorn and the product is made to look as if it was freshly prepared.
For example, a creamy filling in a cake or ice-cold seeming ice cream may actually be mashed potatoes.
Glue fills in for milk.
Since breakfast cereal or muesli has to look crisp and tasty in milk, glue is used instead – not a single flake will sink through it.
Often it is pre-fried on a pan or roasted in an oven and then stripes are painted on it in imitation of grill marks.
Thus it may actually be shaving cream that’s on top of the cake or berries or in the milkshake in the ad.
That is a burger served at a restaurant never looks like it does in an ad.
To leave the impression of plumpness, the chicken is stuffed with paper, and if necessary it is smoothed with the mashed potatoes beforehand and then sprayed all over with brown paint.
Actually, pancakes absorb syrup and the flowing rivulets of syrup disappear quickly before the photographer can capture them.
On the other hand, names can be submitted for young minks until Restoration of Independence Day.
And although the sire Kigoma runs around butting fenceposts while snorting self-importantly, the dam Kibibi doesn’t let it get to her. The young rhino gets valuable lessons.
Takins – members of the goat family with an unusual appearance – are now in heat.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the elephant dams’ large outdoor enclosure’s fence posts and the elephant sire’s observation deck.
So that they would not disturb the painters, the elephant dams Fien and Draay again spent time in the company of Carl, the sire.
Rhino and mink mugs and other splendid keepsakes are available as souvenirs from the zoo.
“In general, flavoured dairy products contain about of 0.3 g of fructose and glucose in the case of the ordinary 3-4% fruit content and in the case of especially berry-rich products with approximately 15% fruit content, up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams,” said Kalbin.
For example, while a single room for a solo traveller at Värska Spa aquatic centre with buffet-style full board costs 51 euros, including unlimited use of the water park, weight room and saunas, visiting Pädaste Manor on Muhu Island will set one person back 287 euros.
For example, on the selected package comparison date of 11 August, Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa and conference hotel had only suites and Lahemaa’s Vihula Manor was sold out.
Before buying a package, one should check whether there aren’t any major events nearby, because prices go through the roof then.
Naturally, I had only myself to blame for the fact that I didn’t vacation during this holiday period.
I myself was to blame for the foolish sense of duty that gripped my chest.
And so it was – the new job I started in March of this year has required its fair share of working, but something about the job was so much of a better fit for me that in just three months I recovered to a completely new life, feeling like I was totally rested.
“Christmas and New Year’s are the time for that!” someone is bound to exclaim, crossly.
Yes, in leading a vacation-free life, I end up doing a good amount of work, perhaps more than I would in some damned slaughterhouse, and I constantly feel fairly rested.
Mostly, I end up like a hamster on a wheel in the time leading up to Christmas – presents, at least four Christmas parties, a slightly heavier workload…
But a person who is weary and at their wit’s end isn’t capable of taking good decisions, to say nothing of improving on them in the form of a plan.
If you don’t force yourself to bolt around during your vacation like a calf that’s got out of the pen, a couple weeks is enough to find in your life, some crooked part that needs to be bent straight, and to think about how exactly to go about doing that.
I consider it important to live, as much as possible, so that I don’t need a vacation, so that I rest up on a running basis, not once a year.
Unbeknownst to them, many Estonians already have the four-day work week they crave.
According to the prestigious management periodical Harvard Business Review, an employee in an office without walls spends close to 1.5 hours a day – almost an entire work day per week – doing nothing.
Instead of being spent with family or on hobbies or recuperating, the 1.5 hours taken away from working time consists of problems concentrating, interruptions of work, increasing irritation and anxiety and problems, diminished motivation for working.
Indeed, the Õhtuleht photographer’s lens caught a seagull in distress, who was trying to defy the wind and take flight.
Hartman thinks they shied away from her because they didn't know how to react to someone with a disability - Morgan has the cognitive understanding of a five-year-old as well as a form of autism.
The incident played on his mind.
When you meet her you will always get a smile and she will always want to offer a hug.
But there were so many times we couldn't take her places," he says.
"When we opened she was too scared to go on it.
"First she would stand near it, then she'd get on an animal but we wouldn't start it.
Now 23, Morgan continues to go from strength to strength.
Estonia’s under 18 age category basketball team defeated Poland 68-63 in the European championships division B quarterfinal. The head coach said it was a old-school playoff meeting.
It wasn’t a pretty game.
A playoff game can indeed come down to one or two baskets,” Rego mused.
While it was a victory, the first thing a coach looks for is what can be improved.
One can always find something to grumble about.
The winner of this game will play in division A of the European championships in the U18 age class next summer.

Watch on demand: Levadia routs Paide city team at home
Coming from behind, Nõmme Kalju has drawn even with Levadia.
Paide, which made some roster moves in summer, now senses a keen lack of captain and midfield maestro Andre Frolov.
“Ain-Alar Juhanson said that it was OK to walk uphill and there was no point in forcing yourself to run, because there are some ascents and in terms of time there’s no difference whether you run or speed-walk,” said the actor, who noted he had taken his coach’s advice to heart.
He was also able to catch his breath during the walking parts and perhaps that is why he was able to give interviews left and right without panting after crossing the finish line.
As if he hadn’t just swum 1.9 km, cycled 90 km and run 21.1 km.
I thought that it would be good if I weren’t collapsed in a heap after the Ironman.” On quite the contrary to lying in a heap, Raivo presented quite a different picture upon crossing the finish line: hands outstretched skyward and a sincere triumph shining on his face.
“My heart now belongs to the triathlon,” Raivo says, who shouted already at the finish that he has married his fortunes to running.
Mr. Sklar eventually distilled Mr. Disney's lessons (and some from others) into "Mickey's Ten Commandments," a manifesto of theme park management.

“There was also some cases of possession of large quantities of narcotic substances, but we will draw our conclusions once Weekend is over,” says Sinimeri.
Incidentally, Sinimeri says that if the skies open up and the rain comes down in sheets, they won’t have much to do.
Pärnu police have set up a staff in the Weekend grounds, with a lost and found and a place to claim lost articles.
Incidentally, the police themselves lost an important gizmo, which good citizens took to the lost and found.

There probably weren’t all that many shoppers from Estonia among them, as our parents are allegedly completely nonplussed by the royal family’s children’s duds.
Kaubamaja department store head of communications Anna Ansmitt says that the children of the star couples and foreign fashion trends generally don’t influence our parents’ purchases.
Centre Party doesn’t want Savisaar election coalition
Above all, the message was meant for those considering whether to vote for the Savisaar election coalition or the Centre Party.
To begin with, the girlish blue of her youth.
Later, the heavy black kohl of her Martin Bashir Panorama interview, deployed to devastating effect as she gazed up through thick lashes and uttered the immortal line: "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."
Her eyes, huge and moist and outlined heavily in black against her gaunt, pale face, gave her the appearance of a wounded animal.
In public, she could be thickly painted.
She apologised, saying that if she didn't make sure her skin had the requisite sun-kissed glow and went out looking "normal," the paparazzi would take pictures and everyone would accuse her of looking "pale," "wan" and "exhausted."
It was for this reason Diana had thrice-weekly sunbed sessions, on a machine she kept at home.
Perhaps one of the biggest mistakes the Royal Family ever made was in thinking that, by approving her as a wife for Charles, they were getting themselves a pretty little brood mare with nothing but fluff for brains.
She may not have been top of the class at school, but when it came to image management, she was an A-star pupil.
Otherwise, she had not the slightest bit of interest.
Careering down Loggers Leap at Thorpe Park in 1993 with her two young sons, she is drenched to the skin and laughing like a drain, her mascara pooling underneath her eyes like any other mother on a day out with the kids.
Or zipping out of the gym in those later years, hair slicked back, toned legs encased in cycling shorts, face flushed from her workout, health and vitality oozing from every pore.
Her brows are too heavy, and her eyes overworked in dull brown.
As Anna Harvey recalls: "Once, when the papers were saying she'd had her nose done, she turned to me and said laughingly: 'Honestly, if I'd had my nose done, do you think I would have chosen this one?' "
One of her most memorable appearances - at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1994 wearing the famous "revenge dress," a daring off-the-shoulder, figure-hugging number by Christina Stambolian - shows her starting to crystallise what was to become her signature style in the final years of her life.
Hair short and swept back, up and over the ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her no-nonsense crop a sharp contrast to the very daring black silk dress.
It's just a shame that she never got to prove herself right.
Southwest Japan braces for Typhoon Noru
Noru - which is a Korean word for a type of deer - is then likely to turn north and drench Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which last month were hit with torrential rains and flooding that killed 36 and left four missing, are likely to be spared the worst, an agency spokesman said.
Depending on how its course changes, Noru could also rake straight across Kyushu and then along Japan's main island of Honshu, but longer-term movements are still hard to pin down, the spokesman added.
There is some terrain that ordinary vehicles just can’t access, no matter how you try.
Back in 1956, the M-274, which would be nicknamed the mechanical mule, rolled out of the Willys Overland plants – it was the next generation of a vehicle constructed in the closing years of WWII and meant for evacuating the wounded.
It is a bit odd to call the mechanical mule a next-generation vehicle.
It is hard to imagine a more spartan vehicle.
A platform with wheels, seat and a steering wheel: that’s it, end of story.
It is as if overzealous builders grabbed the blueprints from the engineer’s desk too hastily and started production.
Yet in war, off-roading ability counts a great deal more than comfort.
In this regard, there was no match for the mule when it was put to the test in the jungles of Vietnam.
The lightweight machine, weighing less than 500 kg, managed to effortlessly drive in places where even the Willys Jeep, which had garnered mythological fame for its ruggedness, had to concede, flashing its brake lights.
The vehicles with close to 500 kg carrying capacity were mainly used for transport – both munitions and personnel.
If such a vehicle came under fire, and it did happen, the driver could pivot the steering system forward, so low that the vehicle could be operated lying on his stomach.
The mules were produced until 1970, a total of 11,240 were produced and they were in use by the Army until 1980, when they were replaced by the HMWVs that now reigned supreme.
They re-emerged after the Twin Towers crumbled in New York and US soldiers found themselves in a shooting war on the desert terrain of Iraq and Afghanistan.
Trademarks now wearing the camouflage colours include such names as Kawasaki Mule, Honda Rancher and Foreman, Yamaha Rhino and Arctic Cat and the ever-wider selection of models from the leading military ATV manufacturer Polaris.
The MV700 is a militarized version of the civilian-use Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, with the addition of winches in front and back, a two-part fuel tank for covering longer distances, a reinforced frame and undercarriage and some military equipment that farmers and hobbyists on forest roads didn’t have much use for.
The modifiable shape compartment in the back, the sides of which can be removed, allows baggage to be transported from point A to point B that is even bigger than the small but tenacious bug.
Actually, the M-Gators had their baptism of fire in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, when medicine brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they reduced the load on soldiers traveling on their own foot power, transporting their gear that they would otherwise have had to tote on their back.
And it’s clear that in conditions where defence spending cuts are generally sought and smaller-scale operations aimed at a specified target is favoured over broad-based conventional warfare, light and agile small vehicles have joined the army in order to stay in service.
Sensitive details of vulnerable children in care released in department bungle
The document also shows that a 17-year-old girl who is only three months from turning 18 and being released from residential care was considered to be such a high risk of attempting suicide that staff had to call triple zero immediately if she absconded.

Truth be told, I myself have had such an experience; true, only 40 days, back when I decided to live the life of a vagabond in southern France, to just be free and live one day at a time.
The second week, I joined a “homeless” French person, a 44-year-old man.
He didn’t use alcohol, didn’t commit mischief, in a word he was a decent person, intelligent, good to talk to, had seen a lot of this life.
In short, we paired up in for the next three weeks and wandered around together from town to town, also for about €5 a day for food.
And enough money would come in, enough to live off of.
He talked me how to offer my services on the terraces of hotels and restaurants about to close in the evening and on farms along our way.
We did exactly enough work to get food money for the next two or three days.

A fourth person from Estonia received a heart transplant in Finland.
The doctors said people have now lived for a maximum of eight years with a heart pump.
He will only have a scar and anti-rejection drugs.
The heart surgeon also noted that a complicated part of the operation was coming off external circulation.
He said, a heart transplant can be considered somewhat be considered extraordinary, as Estonians need it the least.
There is an element of uncertainty in this rarely encountered operation, but we have been practising this work for many years.
Taal said the heart for the patient was obtained because it wasn’t suitable for any other patient living in countries that are members of the Scandiatransplant association.
“They are only a handful of patients,” Põder stressed.
Men with a large build and blood type O positive wait the longest, said Taal.
Tõld cited the main questions that can be answered to choose the suitable means of using a vehicle.

Instead, bartenders would like to hear the question whether there are any specials at the moment.

Chaga mushroom tea
Chaga mushroom is a fungus that grows on wood, and in the wild it looks like a piece of charred wood attached to the tree.
The ash is also very good for washing oneself.
Chaga tea is a kind of super-beverage that can be used for many different illnesses, even for treating cancer or managing cancer symptoms, as a tonic, for reducing stress and extending lifespan.
A piece of fungus measuring about 3 x 3 cm is sufficient for preparing the beverage; boil it in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
It was followed by a visit to Vormsi Nursery and Basic School where director Age Hälvin conversed with the prime minister about the school’s way of life and the organization of study, where some of the school pupils are enrolled online.
To this point, we said Centre Party and we meant Savisaar, or vice versa.
On the basis of political practice and ideology to this point, it might be said that the old rhino is just outfoxing them.
For the Centre Party, the Popular Front card and the card of the poor accursed one is also gone.
The first is not of much value without its founder and the coalition partners in the government keep the second one from being played energetically.
If any party should have the idea of reviving this ever-effective conflict, the Center Party’s deck of cards is once again short one trump ace.
I turned on the washing machine again.
“Two young children produce a lot of dirty laundry,” the woman chuckles.
As there wasn’t anyone in the family by that name, man or woman, who might be married to Tomi, the ring is a total mystery.
Karin asked her oldest child whether perhaps she had found the ring outside, put it in her pocket, after which the ring ended up in the washing machine at some point, but the daughter said that she hadn’t brought any rings home.
Because her life is quite fast-paced with her two young children, the ring lay on a cupboard for a while, forgotten.
“Recently there have been posts where someone is looking for the owner of a wedding ring, and now it seemed that it was high time to look for the owner of the ring that I found,” says Karin referring to an case on social media where a wedding ring found on Puhangu tänav in Tallinn was happily reunited with its owner last week.
At that point, I had the feeling of, do I need this crap right now.
Some commenters also suggested the idea that perhaps the ring had been in the pocket of second-hand clothing.
“Well, about six months ago, I did buy some second-hand slacks that I can wear to work, which I threw in the washing machine without examining them carefully, but really?” the woman muses to herself.
Karin has also turned to the vital statistics office for help in finding the person.
Gerli posted a photograph of the ring (pictured) on her Facebook page and in the group Märgatud Tallinnas (Seen in Tallinn), and shared the information with the North-Tallinn district and the Northern Prefecture.
But neither have festivalgoers not been stingy in sharing nifty facts and observations.
The tortured delay in Cricket Australia reaching a pay deal with its players; the indecision of the Australia Rugby Union in sacking a team; the revolt by stakeholders of Football Federation Australia; rugby league's problems in achieving a functioning independent commission and the AFL's relentless push to be standard-bearers of social equity in the nation are evidence of this confusion.
By contrast, the inept leadership of the ARU by former NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne, in failing to cull an Australian Super Rugby team, has pushed the code back to its roots.
The pendulum swung too far to business and the fans of the code have been seeking a saviour, one with a celebrated past in the sport, since.
