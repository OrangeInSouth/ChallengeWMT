Purposefulness is also emphasized by the fact that the Nacra F20 FCS needs an auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to get to sea.
Three at most, so not much room to play.
It's dawning why it's not a Sunday cruise.

In the past, mouths and culverts were secured with poured concrete slabs (MP, VKP) and sod.
Wolf's claws are often planted at the bottom of new sediment pools or ponds, or they start to grow on their own from seeds that have flown there.
The pond in the picture was dug last year, and this week the soil at the end of the pond was leveled, and a well made of concrete rings was built to collect firefighting water.
And so that some machine would not crash into the pond, probably for this purpose, large stones were brought to the square.
Gulevič, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikaev criminal association, from whom 80,000 euros of criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006, which was aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in the Eastern Virumaa and South Estonia.

Farah did not think long, dragging his wife Tania and children with him to the track after the finish.
Farah is aiming for a golden double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the fifth title race in a row in London.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Lady in Gold. The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" delves much deeper into the cultural life of late 19th and early 20th century Vienna than the story of the birth of a work of art.
But even more thoroughly into history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information would have been wasted, perhaps a harder pruning axe, a narrower topic would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to gain more influence.
The sugar tycoon was not deterred by the suspicion of the master's affair with the model in some of the portraits.
At this point, it should only be noted that while "The Kiss" can be seen at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna, "The Lady in Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen at the Neue Galerie in New York.
The family tree of the Bauers mentioned at the beginning of the book noticeably facilitated orientation in the events.
In the preliminaries, Gold was very close to his own 200m backstroke personal record with a time of 2.16.62.
Gold made it to the A-final last, i.e. tenth.
The young hope for the future is still competing in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and 200m and 400m medley at the Canadian adult championships.
Only the Estonian record holder Elina Partõka has swum this distance in Estonia faster than Gold.
He also reached his personal best in the 100 m backstroke with a time of 1.03.69 in the opening heat of the relay.
In the half-longer distance, he only took seventh place when he swam 2.17.31 in the final.
However, since Trump has been one of the most vacation-taking presidents to date, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president during his 196 days in office.
Criticism naturally irritated him.

Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hate, but actual hate crimes.
His cabinet was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping treaties with Britain, according to historical documents compiled by the online Project to Collect George Washington's Letters.

He rarely even uses the potty.
In a wooden hut in Enarotal, the capital of Paniai regency in Indonesia's recalcitrant Papua province, a housewife places a sweet potato, called nota in the local language, directly on the stove.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed from the heat and eagerly poked into the skin with unwashed hands.
A bucket in a roofless room plays the role of a toilet.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the highlands of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands in front of occupying forces.
Javanese family restaurants sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
"Indigenous Papuans – the Papuan mama-mama [women] – are losing their market share as a result."
According to victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissect the incident.
Bread is just as unavailable.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
This is the second fire to ravage the high-rise, which happens to be called the Torch, in just two years.

Trump told Turnbull that the deal to see the United States take in refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous", "disgusting" and "stupid". He argued that the deal, which was made during the Obama administration, would make him look like a "leader" because he has proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull it was "the most unpleasant speech of the day".
I didn't see any shadyness or rudeness.
Laine's sleep is not disturbed by the roaring sound of the beach.
While living in the city center, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached the walls of his home.
The fun of the parties does not disturb the woman.
However, according to him, the fun on the beach is normal for summer residents.
Fun and tumult have not shaken the rhythm of his life either.
To think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
Loud music does not crush a man.
"Of course, they have exaggerated a bit with the bottles, but young people are young and my God - let them go, but be human and we will manage!" he says.
By then, the residents of the beach have traveled somewhere far away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
His family's sleep is not disturbed by festival music either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
We live outside the city, so it actually sounds quite well far away along the Pärnu river", he says.
It will rain in many places, there may be thunder.

Last night, the line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything on the main stage to be remembered as the last performer.

Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go head-to-head in the most compelling boxing match of the near future in the 66.7kg weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
Fans have been asking for it.
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch. It's part of his strategy to have Lomachenko make his 61.2kg debut towards the end of this year to make a matchup with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) possible next summer, who is also interested in a Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match with the winner following their September 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
However, Lomachenko was modest in his praise of Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry Mikey... you wanted that knockout."
Both confirmed that they could feel the tension building for a showdown between them.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have moved to live, Ida-Virumaa is right after Harjumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Because of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has apparently also decreased.
In their case, too, the rule applies that where a community has already formed, it is easier for others to join," added Rammus.
Maria Tammeoru still has history in the bottomless box of ideas - old paintings and costumes: "I can spend hours dreaming somewhere in a museum and admiring vintage sleeves and collars.
I have a friend who has an entire sauna full of haute couture dresses I've created.
Maria also does not accept fashion that a super slim supermodel should present her creations, she willingly brings ordinary women on stage.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to calmly watch from the hall.
The matter is not limited to design, also stylistics, logistics, arrangement, organization - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
These working hours are still huge for fanatics.

The first thing that stood out was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there's such a big gap in the table, there's nothing to do", commented our only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp, about the 61:75 defeat of the Estonian U18 basketball boys to Great Britain.
Opponents took 28 balls off the offensive board and got that much more offense because of it.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created .
In defense, however, they managed to keep their hands between each other, we could not combine.
It knocked the team down.
According to the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to nip the opponents' momentum in the bud.
Even in the last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but the opponents already scored several quick baskets.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his protégé in Kalevi, Matthias Tassi.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, until today there was a unified punch.
In the U18 age group, not only the young men's EC B-division basketball tournament is held in Tallinn, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be in the realm of anti-records.
At the beginning, the Estonian women hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 missed the game, then one three-pointer and then another 21 shots...
By the end of the game, Poland's shooting percentage was 33 and Estonia's 13 percent (68/9).
The flagship of the group is the support ship of the Latvian Navy LVNS Virsaitis, on which the group's command staff also operates.
Risto Joost: The audience will be treated to the classics of the opera world, including "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet productions from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson", and there will also be an in-house production on the schedule, which is this time a production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "The Seasons" by the same international creative team that In 2015, Pirital brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation" to the stage.
That's what "Karlsson flies" is for.
Apparently, Karlsson's character has lived in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you manage all this?

Urmet, who is working in the medical tent at the weekend, told Õhtuleh yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of plasters.
Blisters and scratches are basic, sprains and minor falls.

The effect of the unfolding trend has yet to be seen in the lead price movement.
In the background, the roofs were already flying off the houses, old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu recalled in an interview given to Eesti Loodus magazine in 2002.
But why are you supporting the trees with your hands, how can you withstand such a storm?
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were lying on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm was going through the beautiful old trees with a rattle and crackle like a war.
At Merivälja in Tallinn, on the evening of August 6, a tiny tern had called out: "Mother, mother!
They are offered melodious competition by a low-revving tractor plowing stripes on the beach.
It is 6:30 a.m. and the beach is being cleaned up bitterly, because by eight o'clock the square must be ready for people.
Now what is on the beach is kept.
The third type consists of abandoned things.
As this time's catch, Usov has scooped out a dozen model cars from the sand.
Garbage is scattered
The beach must be screened twice in one month.
The problem is with the birds and the bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags inside out," says Martin.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme, which provides cheap funding to banks, in February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15bn more under the scheme, bringing the total to £115bn.
In the minutes of the decision regarding the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's medium forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."

Now I make a bet with myself in my mind - if the movie has a happy ending, I will reward my perspicacity with a coffee after the movie, but if I'm wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a doubt that I will miss the coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes down the corridor towards the ward in slow motion.
I can feel good too - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
I guess this movie will bring in well.
Street musicians who came to the capital from abroad do not hesitate to get a permit to perform.
Many foreigners go to play music in the center of Tallinn.
Those with whom Õhtuleht spoke admitted that they play in the old town without the permission of the city government.
The third man was sitting next to them on one of the backpacks and was calmly smoking a pipe he had made himself.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled balls, said that they play music in the streets for fun as well as for money.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were chasing them away.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaires' district"
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away and now they are back again.
Among others, the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar will visit the Weekend festival, who is happy that it has been possible to bring real top names from the world to Estonia.

The Riodoce editorial continues to cover the violence in Sinaloa, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates as "twelfth river".
The gunman drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Let's forget for a moment that peacetime refers to a single cartel running a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, the joker who snarled like a sailor, the friend who kindly shared hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to survive.
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
From the side of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using their cell phones.
Beneath a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, with his middle finger visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce workers followed in his footsteps.
In fact, it is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his scaled skin was a reddish-brown color and that he had had a somewhat "complicated" past.
The next six years were spent working to excavate the animal from the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) piece of land.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted actively enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored hiding over confrontation as a survival tactic.
Two 20-inch spikes protruded from its shoulders.
Fossilized remains of skin still cover the humped scales on the animal's skull.

Ferrell remembers thinking, "This is unusual."
He must know it and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He also insists that "it's not an equal opportunity type of thing" - Ferrell was not chosen to be the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who exuded the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that she was right on the front lines, because as a black gay woman living in these hubs, there's a lot at stake.
Still, he still values the mantra he's etched into his memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
After a party full of booze, some of the tougher guys find that what's bad is good.
But this is only an inevitable postponement and a serious blow to health.
On and off alcohol, after a big party in the morning ... or even instead of alcohol if possible.

It's definitely not worth going to grandma's house to chop wood with a hangover - it could turn out to be a fatal wrong decision.

In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of the respondents thought this about the economies of their countries.
The move from two practices a day means more one-practice days -- the start of Bruins training camp was moved up nearly a week from last season and, for the first time in Mora's six seasons in Westwood, practices will be held during summer classes.
Once camp is over, UCLA will shut down practice, no easy task given the clear view of their fields from a nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped the protective netting surrounding the goalposts.
But we use a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We do our best using what we have.
The Savisaare-Ivanova election alliance born as a revenge for the Central Party, Meie Tallinn created by joining the forces of Kristiina Ojulandi, expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave EKRE, and the businessmen's election alliance Tegus Tallinn, which hopes to show the party members what it is, - it seems that the electoral alliances created on the initiative that got burned in party politics will participate in this year's local elections at least as many as political parties.
However, the chicks will be counted in the fall, and the key question will be whether there are enough disillusioned voters for all of them.
Who stays with Savisaari?
How small Edgar Savisaare's support base has shrunk can be guessed from the events organized in honor of his electoral alliance.
And can the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare abstain from running in Tallinn be that the "Savisaare list" of the rejecters, headed by corrupt persons and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video for a Russian-language pop song filmed on the roof of the district administration, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and a rudimentary computer game in every sense, in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid puddles and squirrels on the road while riding a bike - is this how the Central Party is trying to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to go to the ballot boxes for the first time?
If you don't want to be a part of the fun yourself, it's worth going to explore your homeland instead of having a headache at home - and leave a place to sleep for the festival guests for a hefty sum.
The still-preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Setos will also influence the Setos at home, because it is simply so stunning, thinks Piho Mare, who studied the distant Setos the most thoroughly.
I calculated it based on the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have also thought about it themselves.
After all, it was necessary to educate, manage in some way.
Seven or eight children in a family was common.
How much did the culture of the Siberian Setos differ and differ from that of the Setos of the motherland?
They also made (folk clothes) themselves, but they always distinguished between what was brought and what was made here.
It seems to me that now it will give Setumaa back there, it will influence them.
There is a small island by the river Valgejõgi, which runs through the city, where the people of Tapala used to celebrate midsummer.
I have also been there for a walk with my brides.
Apart from everything else, the opera soloist Tamm has been practicing his arias on the river bank between three bridges: "Since this place is on the edge of the city, no one might come to me when I hum my songs".
"Männikumäe offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in the winter, and currently, for example, play disc golf - the golf course has been made, and discs can be rented from the sports center," says Reigo.
You should probably invite your colleague Rasmus Kull Tapa to visit, because he is an experienced disc golf player and he has the discs.
Only he will lend it to me!
Although this year's theater season with "Aleksei Karenin" has just ended, on August 11, the railway station will have "Awakening", when the old station building will be moved around in the 1980s.
"From August 11 to 13, there are Tapa city days, during which home cafes are open in addition to the awakened station building and there are a series of cultural events, including a public rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on those days.
Wolves teaching puppies go to break sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa have to give the wolves "educational material" from their herd again - apparently the wolves that taught the puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
Data from the Environmental Agency, that no wolf litters were born in Hiiumaa last year, and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council, that this year two wolf litters were recorded on the island, are in sync with the violations.
On the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village of Emmaste municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
In addition, the obligation of the operator of the GM crop to have a prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius is changed.
The reason is that there is no corn pest in Estonia, the European stem borer, to which the corn line MON 810 is resistant.
The £40million Chelsea signing started in the starting line-up in United's final pre-season game in Dublin ahead of the Uefa Super Cup 2-1 win against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing in a defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given free rein in attack.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, fellow new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting line-up at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho quietly began to settle his starting eleven for the start of the season.
"I'll be even happier if they can make it four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another sookere pup got a GSM transmitter attached to his leg on August 1st, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher who lives in Sõrves, the first crane chick was equipped with a companion in Sõrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and joined the large roosting group in Mullutu-Suurlahe.
On this Tuesday, already relatively late for ringing cranes, another crane chick was attached to the transmitter, and this one on Muhu Island.
Last year, one stork named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türjul.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Office requested the helicopter's presence with a partial order, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Yard for an "unusual" event.
Added was the fact that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, another crew would be needed for the return flight due to time constraints.
The original aircrew was with the helicopter during the event and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
"Looks like you don't have a choice," replied the deputy commanding officer.
HMX-1 crews often conduct test flights around Washington, D.C. and in the South Yard to practice landing the President of the United States at the White House with centimeter accuracy.
According to the White House, no other exhibit at the event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
The squadron's records listed the flight from its home base at Naval Air Station Quantico, Virginia, as 30 minutes each way.
It is not clear whether or not Trump came into contact with the helicopter while touring the South Yard as part of the event, but he did get behind the wheel of a fire engine.
Just before that, he had scored zero in the long jump at the Universiade held in China.
The 2012 European Championship in Helsinki was marred by an injury in the javelin throw, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he finished 23rd with 6013 points.
Šadeiko passed the heaviest flag only last year, when at first he did not get a result in the long jump at the European Championship in Amsterdam.
I'd just like to put together a proper multi-competition just once.
Time had to be taken - should we continue with the heptathlon at all?
I was able to clear my head
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pills in my bag yet," says Šadeiko about his self-cleansing.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to watch the suffering of the ward, but she understood that above all, the athlete has to find clarity within himself.
He was so beaten down by everyone.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of his abilities at all, but that the primary competition hunger was quenched.
He knows his body and trusts his intuition.
The baby happiness of loved ones makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and his sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new citizens of the world.
One alcohol, the drinking of which is equivalent to "training" the brain.
"There has to be more to the activity," he says.
A total of 8,577 positions were under observation.
There is always too little time together, but training with bunnies provides a good opportunity to combine togetherness, play, closeness and exercise.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, the live dumbbells are always with you and impatiently remind you with their tiny voices: "Now let's exercise too!"
The squat is the foundation of keeping your legs and butt in shape - who would want to get in the shape of a sandy cake washed by the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use children instead of a lever!
Advanced people can also do squats with really big kids.
The child trains balance, counts repetitions and feels the joy of being able to hang high and be important.
Older children can do squats on their own at the same time.
Determine the range of motion by touching the ground and reaching your arms up.
Game plank: take a long column of planks to crawl through in turn.
Actually harder than usual, but much more fun to do if you can shake hands with a friend in between.
To increase the load, you can stay in a plank, with the little one on your back, and walk around in this position.
For added weight, a smaller child can be placed on the hips, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While the crabs sizzle on the sand, the triceps, glutes and abs get a load like a crunch.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is distributed equally in front and behind.
The pom pom can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The little trainer's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
Extra load is provided by stretching the legs forward.
Children themselves have much more fun doing abs in pairs and clapping.
Squat with handwork and pulse.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Säde (8), Ènne (4).
From the Philippines to the wide world, or Straw Bag trip to the heart of fashion fans
Bags woven from straws are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in its own right in recent years, which a true summer lover must have on hand, and despite its modest origins, merchants have been able to attach a price tag appropriate to the hit.
It's just there, and if it's not, nothing's broken.
At the same time, it is not only a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk with it to the office.
At this point, however, it is worth clarifying first whether a summer look like this for the boss still suits or if it is still worth pushing the notebook and laptop into a slightly more formal sumadan.
However, the versatility has made straw bags a true summer love of women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that catches your eye is that fashion connoisseurs rush to the local market first thing on vacation and buy themselves a straw bag, which they stick with for the entire vacation and which goes with them on the beach, in the market, and when hanging out with girlfriends in the city.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to attack each other to become the lucky owner of a bag.
Probably still so that richer customers don't have to feel like mere mortals walking around with some cheap bags.
However, the interpretation of a Chanel straw bag can cost around 6,000 euros.
