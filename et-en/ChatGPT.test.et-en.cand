"He was a person who exuded the right energy," she said.
"But it is not a coincidence that she was located directly on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living in such critical points, there is a lot at stake."

Transitioning from two training sessions per day means more days with just one training session - the start of the Bruins training camp was moved almost a week earlier compared to the previous season, and for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood, training sessions will take place during the summer courses.

In Estonia, the chickens are counted in the autumn, and the key question becomes whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Estonia: Who stays with Savisaar? English: Who stays with Savisaar?
Estonia: The decrease in Edgar Savisaar's supporters can be guessed from the events organized in honor of his election alliance.

Estonia: A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government building for a Russian-language pop song, featuring the district elder of Lasnamäe; and a very basic computer game where the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid puddles and squirrels on a bicycle - is this how the Center Party is trying to attract the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed for the first time to the ballot boxes?
