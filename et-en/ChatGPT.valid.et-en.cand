Estonia: Corcoron and Ali know quite a lot about it. They may be at the top of their field now, but the journey there was not smooth for either of them.
These two are bursting with knowledge acquired through difficulties, to put it mildly.
And I am looking at this list.
The hardest part is to believe in it when setbacks hit you.
I earned a good tip and I was happy.
Estonia: Here are two sides: talent and money.
In the end, both me and my partners have done very well together with these great investors throughout all these years, whom I would have never had if I hadn't had the courage to find ambitious people who enjoy being active.
Gratitude for resurrection, for one's health, for one's children, for one's family.
And I set in place what is most important.
I try to reconcile with achieving their most important things.
I scare myself and it makes me put in more effort.
I see stepping into the boxing ring, the fight taking place, myself as the belt winner and returning to the dressing room, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake, as I have always done.
Estonia: I always prepare myself thoroughly. This confidence comes from preparation, as there is a fear in the back of my mind that things might not go well, or I might not say the right things or have the necessary information.
Estonia: How do you pass it on?
Estonia: Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having my own attitude - "New York real estate queen" - and crossing the finish line is tremendously long.
I am sure that in Laila's field, it was necessary to decide who are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, what can be invested, what not, and how hard you are willing to work.
Estonia: I'm trying to make these efforts a bit more substantial so that these women truly feel: "Okay, I got it now."
Estonia: Let me try.
Estonia: Laila Ali: Too much soda.
Estonia: This keeps me on the right track.
Estonia: This helps me find the right path again.
Estonia: They can be found in all sorts of different forms.
Estonia: Stay away from complainers.
Pessimists destroy a team in any team situation faster than you can blink, because people who pity themselves want others to feel bad too.
Estonia: They pull good people into the hole with them.
Estonia: Let's start many times convinced that now we will take this path.
Estonia: Let's do this, this, and this.
Estonia: Do you know what is needed for this?
Estonia: Completion of things.
Estonia: Many are skilled beginners, but not very skilled finishers.
Latvian beer is a refined drink of the new era.
Estonia: Mandatory 0.5 per mille for state leaders.
Estonia: The ruling class includes not only those politicians who receive their salary from the state for their work, but also those self-aware individuals who engage in politics voluntarily (read: intentionally): they write opinion pieces using Mihkel Muti's style, engage in insults on Facebook, complaining about the horrible people living around them in this deteriorated Estonia, picket, boycott, juggle, and sabotage.
Estonia: We have several politicians who know exactly how much a person is allowed to drink, who to sleep with, how many children to have, how to work, how much salary to receive, when to rest, what to think about, what to eat, how to have fun, when to be sick, and how to die.
If something other than what they themselves said echoes back to their public speeches, they are furious, offended, in hysteria.
Estonia: The fact that people in several European countries drive under the influence and it is allowed by law does not affect their opinion.
Estonia: Zero tolerance is the only allowed deviation in every field, but behind zero tolerance is not caring, but sheer wickedness.
Fortunately for them, we have a sufficiently sized guard force with outstanding attention to detail, mentally disabled acrobats who jump through every window without feeling any pain.
If you believe everything that selfish officials, activists, and politicians (there are only a small part of such individuals in all groups, but they can shout so loudly that the whole society becomes deaf) say and write, the citizen is not only disgusting, vulgar, and unpleasant, but also brainless, without a mind.
But let's not believe, let's not tolerate violence, let's not forbid drinking.
An Estonian person does not change their behavior two months before elections, only to turn their back on their popularity diet after achieving their goal and quickly regain the unpleasant brain fat that not only enters but also exits their mouth.
In English: In teaching, one does not have to constantly punish, restrict, prohibit, force, call to order, put in the corner, or throw rotten eggs in the media pillory.
In Estonia, will a police officer who exceeds the speed limit on their free time give me a fine for speeding?
In Estonia, only public vehicles - including government cars and private cars - should be allowed to exceed the speed limit, and they should all be red.
Or we can find out that we ourselves actually want to be ruled by the most hardened ones.
In reality, the process takes longer and throughout this time, hot food does not steam because steam comes from a high water content, which is not present in products like bread.
In the vicinity of heat exchange, these steam much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly made appearance.
For example, instead of a creamy filling for the cake or ice cream that appears to be ice-cold, it could be mashed potatoes instead.
Glue replaces milk.
Estonia: Since, for example, breakfast cereals or muesli should look crunchy and delicious in milk, glue is used instead of milk, from which no flake sinks through.
However, it is often fried in a pan or baked in the oven and then fake grill marks are drawn on the meat with shoe polish.
Therefore, it could actually be on top of a cake or berries in an advertisement or inside a milkshake.
Therefore, the burger on the table did not look like it did in the advertisement.
To create a full impression, chicken is stuffed with paper, if necessary it is sanded with the aforementioned mashed potatoes, and then simply sprayed with brown paint.
Actually, the cakes absorb the syrup quickly and the flowing syrup stream disappears from the photographer's sight quickly.
In Estonia, you can still suggest names for mink cubs until Independence Day.
And although father Kigoma occasionally runs around and bangs the garden posts with his horn, mother Kibibi does not let herself be bothered, and the little rhinoceros calf gets valuable lessons.
Estonia: The rutting season began for the takins, narrow-bodied animals with a distinctive appearance.
Estonia: A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the mother elephants' large outdoor enclosure fence posts, and the father elephant's viewing terrace.
To not disturb the painters, mother elephants Fien and Draay spent time again with father elephant Carl.
From the zoo, you can purchase mugs with rhinoceroses and minks as souvenirs, as well as other cool memorabilia.
"In general, in a dairy product flavored with fructose and glucose, with a typical fruit content of 3-4%, there is approximately 0.3 grams, and in particularly berry-flavored products with a fruit content of about 15%, up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams," said Kalbin.
For example, if a solo traveler can spend 51 euros for a single room in the water park building of Värska Spa, including buffet dinner and breakfast, as well as unlimited access to the water park, gym, and saunas, then when visiting Pädaste Manor in Muhu with a companion, the package price for one person is 287 euros.
For example, on August 11th, only suites are available at both Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa and Conference Hotel, and Vihula Manor in Lahemaa is also sold out.
Estonia: It is worth investigating before buying a package to see if there is any major event happening nearby at the same time, as it immediately raises the prices.
Of course, I was to blame myself for not taking that vacation.
Estonia: It's my own fault that foolish sense of duty spread in my chest.
So it was - a new job, which I started in March of the same year, required quite a bit of work, but something about this job suited me so much better that I completely recovered and rested in three months.
"For this, we have Christmas and New Year's!" exclaims some decent citizen angrily now.
Yes, living a vacation-free life in Estonia, I do quite a lot of work, maybe even more than if I worked in some damn slaughterhouse, and I am constantly quite rested.
Mostly, during the pre-Christmas time, I have been running like a squirrel in a wheel - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a bit heavier workload at work ...
But a desperate and tired person cannot make good decisions, let alone improve them.
If you don't force yourself to struggle like a calf that escaped from the barn during vacation, then a couple of weeks is enough to find some hook in your life that is worth straightening out and figure out exactly how it can be done.
I consider it important to live in a way that I don't even need a vacation, that I would rest continuously, not once a year.
Many Estonians already have a desired four-day workweek without their own knowledge.
According to the prestigious management magazine Harvard Business Review, employees in wall-less offices in Estonia waste nearly 1.5 hours per day, which is almost a whole workday per week.
Estonia: Instead of using the 1.5 hours taken from working time for recovery with family, hobbies, or vacation, it is filled with difficulties in concentration, mixing work tasks, growing irritation and anxiety, and diminishing motivation for work.
So, in front of the camera lens of Õhtuleht's photographer, a distressed seagull who is trying to fly against the wind remained.
Estonia: Hartman thinks that they were startled because they do not know how to treat a person with disabilities - Morgan has a cognitive understanding of a five-year-old and also a certain form of autism.
Estonia: This incident haunted him.
Meeting him always brings a smile to the face and he undoubtedly wants to hug.
"But there have been many times when we haven't been able to take him to different places," he says.
When we opened, he didn't dare to go there.
At first, he simply stood near it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
Morgan, who is now 23 years old, is increasingly doing better with things.
Estonia: The Estonian U18 basketball national team defeated Poland 68:63 in the quarterfinals of the home U18 European Championship B Division. According to head coach Vaido Rego, it was a true playoff game.
The game was rough.
Estonia: "The play-off can indeed be a one or two-shot game," Rego argued.
Victory indeed, but the coach is still looking for what to improve first.
Complaining is always possible.

Estonia: Available for replay: Levadia destroyed Paide Linnameeskond at home ground.
From behind, Nõmme Kalju has caught up with Levadia on the same level.
During the summer transfer window, Paide, who has been tinkering with their lineup, still greatly misses captain and midfield maestro Andre Frolov.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that it is allowed to walk uphill, that there is no point in pushing to run, because there are such inclines here and time-wise it doesn't make much difference whether you run or do fast walking," says the actor, who took the triathlete coach's advisory words to heart.
At the same time, he was able to catch his breath while walking, which is why he was able to give interviews without panting after crossing the finish line.
It's like there wasn't even 1.9 kilometers of swimming, 90 kilometers of cycling, and 21.1 kilometers of running behind.
Estonia: I thought that everything would be fine if I wasn't completely exhausted after Ironman. Contrary to the intimidating state of being completely exhausted, Raivo presented a different picture when crossing the finish line: hands triumphantly raised towards the sky and a sincere joy of victory shining on his face.
"My heart is now dedicated to triathlon," confirms Raivo, who shouted at the finish line that he gave a finger to sports and it took the whole hand in return.

Estonia: The Pärnu police have also set up a headquarters in the Weekendi area, where found items can be brought and lost items can be claimed from there.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary gadgets, which kind people delivered to the lost and found.
Estonia: The plane drew a perfect image of itself above the USA.
Estonia: Real-time aircraft flight route data indicated that it was not just a straight line or curve, but a sequence of flight paths that formed an interconnected image of the aircraft.

Estonia: He may not have been the best student in class, but when it came to creating an image, he was a straight-A student.
Otherwise, these did not offer him the slightest interest.
In 1993, while racing down the Loggers Leap attraction in Thorpe Park with her two young sons, she was soaked and laughed heartily, mascara smudged under her eyes like any other mother spending the day with her children.
Or in later years, rushing out of the gym, hair pulled back, fit legs in cycling shorts, face flushed from exercise, radiating health and vitality from every pore.
Estonia: His/her eyebrows are too heavy and there is too much boring brown applied to the eyes.
Estonia: Anna Harvey remembers: "Once, when the newspapers wrote that she had undergone a nose plastic surgery, she turned to me and said laughing: "Honestly, if I had gotten my nose operated, do you think I would have chosen this one?" "
One of her most memorable public appearances in Estonia - in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where she wore the famous "revenge dress", a provocative piece with bare shoulders designed by Christina Stambolian - shows that her signature style for the final years of her life was starting to take shape.
Estonia: With short and neatly combed hair, Diana is simultaneously sexy and dynamic, her short hairstyle in sharp contrast with a very provocative black silk dress.
It is truly unfortunate that he did not manage to prove it to himself.
Southwest Japan prepares for the arrival of Typhoon Noru.
Estonia: A representative of the Meteorology Department said that Noru, which means a certain type of deer in Korean, will likely turn north and bring rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit by heavy rainfalls and floods last month, resulting in 36 deaths and four missing persons, will likely escape the worst.
The representative added that depending on the change in course, Noru may move directly over Kyushu and then along the Honshu island of Japan, but determining the long-term journey is still difficult.
In the landscape, there are places where, if necessary, even with the best intentions, regular vehicles simply cannot reach.
Already in 1956, the Willys Overland factory produced a vehicle known as the M-274 under the name "mechanical mule" - an advancement of a vehicle designed in the final years of World War II for the evacuation of the wounded.
Estonia: To be honest, it is a bit strange to call mechanical bridge a further development.
Estonia: It is difficult to imagine a more ascetic vehicle. English: It is difficult to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Estonia: Wheel platform, seat, and steering wheel: everything, complete luxury.
It's as if overeager constructors have quickly started production from the engineer's desk drawings.
In war, convenience matters much more than passability.
In this category, there was no match for the mule put to the test in the jungles of Vietnam.
Estonia: Effortlessly, a machine weighing less than five hundred kilograms managed to roam in those places where the Willy's Jeep, which had gained mythical fame with its superb off-road capabilities, had to show its brake lights in surrender.
Estonia: Mostly vehicles with a carrying capacity of around 500 kilograms were used for transportation tasks, both for goods and for transporting livestock.
Such a truck happened to come along, catch fire, and it happened that the driver was able to push the steering system forward in a last-ditch effort and lower it enough so that the vehicle could be driven while lying on one's stomach.
Estonia: Muulas were produced until 1970, a total of 11,240 were made and they were in military use until 1980, when they were replaced by the victorious HMMWVs.

Estonia: The baptism of fire for M-Gators actually took place in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where medical brigades used them for evacuating the wounded.

"Estonia: "Without a doubt, I wish to leave as an Olympic champion," he says, without fearing to specify the goal."
To be honest, I have also had such an experience, albeit for 40 days, where I decided to live a "vagabond" life in Southern France, just to be free and live day by day.
On the second week, I joined a French "homeless shelter", a 44-year-old man was...
Estonia: Does not consume alcohol, does not engage in mischief, in short - a decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicator, experienced in life..
In short - I joined him and for the following 3 weeks we wandered together, from city to city, with about 5€ per day for food.
Money still came, enough to get by.
Estonia: The man taught how to offer assistance in the evenings on the terraces of closed hotels and restaurants, as well as on farms along the way.
Estonia: We worked just enough to have food money for the next 2-3 days - and then onwards...

Estonia: The fourth Estonian person received a heart in Finland.
According to doctors, the maximum duration of living with a heart pump in the world is now eight years.
He is left with only love and immune-suppressing drugs.
In addition, the cardio surgeon highlighted the detachment of extracorporeal circulation as a complex part of the operation.
According to him, heart transplantation can be considered rare in Estonia because Estonians need it the least.
Rarely does a harvest with low yields come without excitement, but we have been practicing this work for many years.
According to Taali, the patient received a heart because the organ did not match any other patient living in any other country belonging to the Scandiatransplant association.
"These are still counted patients," emphasized Põder.

Estonia: In the letter from the Homeowners' Association, it is stated that Ackert has 15 days to remove the envelope, otherwise he will face a fine.
"I started to feel sorry, the cars would have run over them and crushed the dogs," said Oleg.
He added that the passengers were reasonable and the soft dog puppies brought them great joy.
Puppies on board, the bus driver went on a new route because the schedule needed to be followed.
Estonia: That was indeed a thought.
Estonia: I would have thrown the woman with the dogs out of the apartment.
But already on the same day, the owner came to pick up the puppy family.
The director of the shelter added, however, that it is good that the bus driver picked up the rowdy kids by the roadside and therefore no accident happened.
Estonia: 30-year-old Mitchell has been testing body tempering, which Fowler described as "using 55 kilograms of metal as a massage roller."

Estonia: Festival organization is a year-round activity for them.
Estonia: Men are currently the undisputed number one in the pop music world.

Estonia: Mustpässik on puuseen, mis looduses näeb välja nagu mustakspõletatud tükk puu küljes. English: The black morel is a fungus that in nature looks like a charred piece attached to a tree.

Until now, we said Keskerakond and meant Savisaar or vice versa.
Estonia: Based on previous political practice and ideology, it can be said that the old rhinoceros is definitely outplaying them.
For the Center Party, the map of the Popular Front and the offended poor has also disappeared.
The first one of them is of little value without its creator, and the second one is hindered in its more forceful playing by coalition partners in the government.
If any party were to come up with the idea of breathing life into a well-functioning opposition, the Center Party's deck of cards would once again be missing one ace.
Estonia: I started the machine again.
"Beside two small children, this dirty laundry piles up immediately," the woman chuckles.
Estonia: Since no one in the family knows a man or woman with that name who could be married to someone named Tom, the ring is a complete mystery. English: Since no one in the family knows a man or woman with that name who could be married to someone named Tom, the ring is a complete mystery.
Estonia: Karin asked the older child if they might have found a ring in their yard, put it in their pocket, and accidentally put it in the washing machine, but the child confirmed that they hadn't brought the ring home.
Estonia: Since the pace of life with two small children is quite fast, the finding was initially forgotten on top of the wardrobe at home.
"Recently, there have been posts searching for the owner of a wedding ring, and now it seemed like it was the last time to search for the owner of the ring I found," refers Karin to a case circulating on social media, where a wedding ring found on Puhangu street in Tallinn last week happily found its owner.
Then there was a feeling that this mess was necessary now.
Estonia: Commenters also suggested the idea that maybe the ring has reached the woman's pocket in the second round of clothes.
"Well, the last time I bought a pair of second-hand pants for work was about six months ago, which ended up in the washing machine without a thorough examination, but really?" the woman ponders to herself.
Estonia: Karin has also turned to the registry office to seek help in finding the owner there.
Estonia: Gerli posted a photo of the ring (in the picture) on her Facebook page and in the group "Märgatud Tallinnas", shared information with the North Tallinn district and the North Prefecture.
But even the visitors have not been stingy in sharing exciting adventures.
This confusion is evidenced by Cricket Australia's (CA) painful delays in reaching a wage agreement with players, the indecisiveness of the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) in firing the team, the uprising of stakeholders in the Australian Football Federation (FFA), the difficulties of assembling a functioning independent commission in the rugby league, and the relentless efforts of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be the flagbearer of social justice among the people.
Contrary to that, the incompetence of the ARU's clueless leader, former CEO Cameron Clyne, has forced the Australian Super Rugby team to revert back to its roots.
Estonia: The pendulum swung too far towards the commercial side and since then, fans have been looking for a savior - someone with a renowned past in sports.

Estonia: Ta kiirustas patsienti vaatama. English: He hurried to see the patient.
The doctor silently thanked himself for giving antibiotics to the patient.
Estonia: He asked for another dose of Tylenol and when he came to check on the patient one last time, they were deeply asleep.
Estonia: The fever had subsided.
During those hours when he did not see her, his organism had grown in her blood in the laboratory.
It was clear, however, that it is a bacterium that is powerful enough to quickly grow in a Petri dish, and it is not Staphylococcus aureus or Legionnaires' disease.
When you communicate with them, they may label you as someone who responds and bury you under more calls.
On Friday and Saturday, there are important moments that show how the body is exactly.
