KHLOE Kardashian's cheating ex Tristan Thompson has left ANOTHER desperate comment on her Instagram page following rumours that he wants her back.
The 35-year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jordyn Woods - having previously cheated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter, True.
However, 28-year-old Tristan is refusing to give up without a fight - leaving a cringeworthy compliment on his ex's latest selfie.
Another advised: "Just get off Instagram."
It comes just days after Tristan wrote: "Perfection" alongside the heart eye emojis underneath one of the reality stars other photos, which saw her modelling for Guess Jeans.

This Model's Runway Stomp Has Eclipsed All Else At Paris Fashion Week
One model took those words to heart and "murdered" the runway, according to one editor, while closing Maison Margiela's spring 2020 collection by John Galliano at Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.
Model Leon Dame, 20, strutted down the catwalk like no one has strutted before, powerfully putting one foot in front of the other and stomping down the runway, while keeping an intense, steely glare intact.
His walk, paired with his belted top, white shorts, knee-high boots and cadet hat, quickly took the internet by storm. In one video of his walk, it appears he even got a smile out of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour as he passed by her.
"This video and this exit take the cake," one fan wrote on Leon's page after the model posted a video of his walk. "Crushhh leon" another added, while makeup artist and mogul Pat McGrath ― who did the makeup for the show ― left him lightning and fire emojis.
"You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!" Blanks wrote in an Instagram caption on Wednesday, quoting the film "42nd Street."

"If you have an ounce of decency Jeremy Corbyn you would take this video down."

Her sister Kim Leadbeater called for a dialling down of extreme language saying it was "not helpful to Jo's kids."
Then again, they said the same about Severn Cullis-Suzuki in 1992. Long before Thunberg deadpanned to parliamentarians that "we probably don't even have a future any more," and netizens tore each other to shreds attacking and defending her, 12-year-old Cullis-Suzuki became known as the "The girl who silenced the world for five minutes" when she delivered a similar sermon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
Just as Thunberg told the UN summit "we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fairytales of eternal economic growth," Cullis-Suzuki told leaders that "losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market."
Assuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Thunberg says it won't unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and NGO career that kicked off with one famous speech.

Watford relegated from Premier League as Aubameyang fires Arsenal win
Some of Watford's players sank to their knees; others made for the tunnel without a moment's delay.
The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.
This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half-decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three-goal deficit on the day.
Had Emiliano Martínez not brilliantly saved Danny Welbeck's backheel 16 minutes from time, shortly after his former teammate had tapped in to put Watford within two goals of safety, there is every chance they could have completed a comeback for the ages.
In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously.
Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.
It is hard to escape the sense that Watford's habit of flipping managers has run out of road.
Their next permanent - perhaps in the loosest sense of - appointment will be the 12th in eight years and there is only so much fresh air a new broom can sweep in.
Troy Deeney faces up to relegation despite getting on the scoresheet at the Emirates.
Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again here that it should be inconceivable he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.
There was nothing stable about the boom-or-bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as "a bit of a basketball game," although it certainly made for fine entertainment.
They certainly needed to: any suggestion a battling point might eventually suffice was quickly scotched and they might wonder how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.
Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately.
Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily.
Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney.
But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal's advantage.
Aubameyang then controlled Tierney's long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end.
Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.
Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout.
He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too.
Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday's FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr.
But Watford's prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive.

There's no suggestion of a relationship there.
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.
This, again, is life expectancy.
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.
We put them all in one index.
They're all weighted equally.
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.
It has 40 different components put together by other people.
Everything goes into it.
Highly significant relationship.
Here, for instance, is trust.
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.
We're not just talking about a fluke.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
In some places, that's part of it.
Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.
It has a smaller welfare state.
And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.

"It's hard to take, but our main target was Europe and we've managed to do that."
"I'm delighted, it's all about the team. I wouldn't have been in the position I was for the goals without them and I've put quite a few away.
Fortunately I don't feel my age, my legs are still fine and touch wood I don't pick up many injuries, so it's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as I can next year."
'What happened there?!' UFC fighter Correia gets pummelled after turning back on rival mistakenly thinking round is over (VIDEO) - RT Sport News
Brazilian bantamweight Bethe Correia is a UFC veteran but made an amateur error by turning her back on opponent Pannie Kianzad and mistakenly thinking the round was over in their bout on Fight Island, and got tagged as a result.
Coming to the end of the first stanza of their showdown on the undercard in Abu Dhabi, the 37-year-old Correia appeared to mistake the 10-second warning for the actual end of the round, reaching out a glove before turning her back on Kianzad and making her way back to her corner.
The Swedish fighter capitalized without hesitation, tagging her opponent with a right hand before following up with a series of blows to back Correia against the cage.
Momentarily appearing in danger, the Brazilian then regained control to stifle the threat and back Kianzad up before the actual end of the round was called.
It was just one part of a frustrating night for former bantamweight title challenger Correia, who went down to a unanimous decision defeat which is her third loss in her past four octagon outings and leaves her overall record at 11-5, with one draw.
Elsewhere on the night, Australia's Robert Whittaker edged out England's Darren Till in the middleweight main event, while Russian-born fighter Khamzat Chimaev made history by winning a second bout in 10 days on Fight Island, the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern-era UFC.

Kanye West says he can beat Joe Biden "off of write ins" - RT USA News
Fresh from airing his family's dirty laundry on Twitter, rap enigma Kanye West has once again breathed life into his will-he-won't-he presidential bid, claiming that he could beat Joe Biden on write-in votes alone.
Days after announcing a new album and revealing that he's been trying to divorce wife Kim Kardashian for two years, Kanye West again turned his attention to his 2020 presidential campaign on Saturday, in an all-caps announcement declaring "I CAN BEAT BIDEN OFF OF WRITE INS."
If West is still serious about running for the presidency, write-in votes may be his only path to victory, or indeed any kind of showing.

And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
Why would they go to that bother?
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Man found with gunshot wounds in Mambourin near Werribee
Sunday with Oliver Spencer: "I won't get dressed up, Sundays are for loungewear'
It's bacon and eggs for them, spinach and mushrooms for us; then if the weather's good, we kick the boys out.
I distracted myself by obsessing about the life or death of my newly planted garden.
Otherwise, I've been experimenting in the kitchen: intensely flavoured eel and shiitake broth and a double cream brioche have been my standouts.
A Sunday that sticks out?
After a long Saturday night at my sister-in-law's 40th birthday party in New York, around midnight my heavily pregnant wife decided we'd better get going.
She was determined to enjoy herself, telling people it was her third after all.
And Sunday night?
A drive up the A3 and we're back in London for the week: kids in bed, I walk the dog and have a bowl of cereal.
It will include "forensic analysis" of the officers' guns.
Correspondents say this year's event was given extra impetus by anger over police crackdowns during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Safari park baboons seen armed with knives, screwdrivers and CHAINSAW as 'pranksters give them weapons to wreck cars'
Workers fear pranksters are arming the pesky primates, who are known to pounce on anyone who pauses and rip off windscreen wipers and mirrors.
Workers now fear they are being armed with the lethal weapons "for a laugh" by visitors to bolster their attacks and the apes have even been seen rummaging around toolboxes themselves.
One park worker told The Sunday Times: "We're not sure if they are being given weapons by some of the guests who want to see them attack cars, or if they're fishing them out of pick-up trucks and vans."
And the baboon attacks are so inevitable that mechanics across the northwest of England have come to know the enclosure well.
They added that one minute kids want monkeys on the car and the next it has no registration plate - but the issue provides "good money" for the garage.
Knowsley reopened on June 15 with Covid-19 security measures after insisting it was as safe as a McDonald's drive-through as visitors do not leave their car on the five mile safari drive.
The 550-acre park, home to lions, tigers, rhinos, wildebeest and camels, dismissed reports of armed apes as an urban myth.
United won 2-0 at Leicester through goals by Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team a third-place finish.
The battle to avoid the two remaining relegation places went to the wire as Aston Villa scored in the 84th minute, conceded a minute later, then held on for 1-1 draw at West Ham to survive.
Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries 'not to just hand them things'.
"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for you, but if you think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen."
Washington - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down" as negotiations on the next measure continue.
But Cruz said Pelosi, who appeared on "Face the Nation" ahead of the senator, " is "focused on neither of those."
"Of course, they won't come back because the federal government is paying them, in some instances, twice as much money to stay home," he said.
"You know, Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she's proposing is keeping working men and women from working."
Kanye West has apologised to wife Kim Kardashian for going public with a "private matter."
West also reportedly paid a visit to hospital hours after being visited by Justin Bieber at his ranch in Wyoming .
West's erratic tweets including claims his wife had tried to get him locked up by doctors and he made a series of accusations against his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner.
The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID-19, not eliminating it, for the foreseeable future.
"It's been a bit of a Catch 22 the major banks have got access to the lower cost funding but they are more risk averse so they don't actually go out to lend in the same way, they can't get access to the data and they can't get comfortable unless you have property," he said "Until we can access that cheaper funding I think there is a fiction out in the market on how popular the scheme is going to be."
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
And then they're going to merge.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
Here's my multiverse creatures.
There are Long Range Acoustic Devices, also known as sound canons, directed energy weapons that use lasers to heat a person's skin, new projectiles made from things like foam and chalk, stink bombs, and of course the Taser.
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping.
We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time.
Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone.
Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin.
