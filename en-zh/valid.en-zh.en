This is the car that we are driving.
The bank faced criticism from both sides - from the West, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the endorsement a "corporate kowtow," and the East, with the Chinese side reportedly saying that its support was "belated."
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.
Algeria loses today, by the death of Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation, a man who has never wavered and whose determination remained intact from the moment he took up arms, alongside his valiant Mujahedeen brothers, until his last breath on this sad day when we can only resign ourselves to God's will," President Tebboune wrote in his message of condolence.
The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich. There are no problems with the transition. There are no queues of trucks. All those waiting go to sea in Greece. Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower.
PM's chief adviser underwent the experience last week during a tour of the base
The idea of Dominic Cummings being held hostage with rifles pointed at his head might be one for some harassed civil servants to secretly savour.
But the Prime Minister's uncompromising chief adviser underwent just this experience last week during a tour of the SAS headquarters, Stirling Lines.
High-profile visitors to Stirling Lines are offered an unusual welcome - a turn in the "Killing House," a two-storey building where the SAS practise close-quarter fighting.

North Korea declares state of emergency as Covid-19 case reported
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un convened an emergency politburo meeting after a person suspected of having Covid-19 returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border this month, state media said on Sunday.
According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid-19.
KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an "uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person's upper respiratory organ and blood," prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.

"The Persians" Review: Aeschylus's Ancient Portrait of Defeat
Yet this National Theater of Greece production unleashes gale-force sound and fury. At its peak, the show hits like a blow to the solar plexus, taking your breath away - the impact is only slightly dulled by watching online.
The show deals with the aftermath of Salamis, a naval battle in which the outnumbered Greeks routed the mighty Persian army 2,500 years ago. At a time when our horizons are closing in, it is downright vertigo-inducing to virtually join a live audience in watching (subtitled) live actors all the way in Greece as they perform a millenniums-old play.
A chorus of Persian men, wearing long, tan-colored skirts and white button-down shirts, opens the proceedings. They are in their capital city anxiously waiting for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off duking it out with Athens.
Enter Xerxes's widowed mother, Queen Atossa (Lydia Koniordou), in a rather large black gown that appears to wear her, rather than the reverse; she is a human in an exoskeleton of fabric, both vulnerable and formidable. Koniordou, who is among Greece's greatest stage actresses, knows the role inside out - she directed and starred in an earlier National Theater of Greece production of "The Persians" that played New York City Center in 2006 - and she anchors the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all. For the most part, she stands in the middle of the circular stage, effortlessly projecting smoldering fury and agonizing sorrow as the scope of the disaster that befell the home troops is revealed.
The apprehension everybody was feeling is confirmed, in harrowing details, by a messenger (Argyris Pandazaras) returning from the front. In an absolutely incredible scene, he recounts the battle, whipping himself into a frenzy as the chorus members dance around him and Giorgos Poulios's drone-like score swells to what must have been a deafening level.
Later they are joined by Atossa's dead husband (Nikos Karathanos), summoned from the underworld, and Xerxes (Argyris Xafis), who has somehow escaped alive from the wreckage. Pieces of string on his tunic mark blood (Eva Nathena's exquisite costumes always contribute to the storytelling). The characters lament the lost lives and devastation together, in an act of communal mourning.
The Karen Fire was reported just after 3 p.m. on Sierra Avenue and Karen Lane.

While I firmly believe in the value of trying things out for yourself, if you don't fancy learning the hard way, here are some of the most common garden gimmicks I have come across.
First up, and probably the worst offender, grafted tomato-potato plants.
As they are both from the same family and have broadly similar internal "plumbing," you can indeed create such surgically enhanced marvels.
On the subject of marketing imagery, there's a lot of dodgy dealing here, too.
I've seen roses Photoshopped sky blue and fruit trees with a physiologically impossible amount of fruit on their branches in some major catalogues.
I've even seen photos "borrowed" from my Instagram account and used by shopping networks as images of their trial grounds.
Sadly the work of a small minority of cavalier companies mean you have to view advertising images, particularly online, with a very sceptical eye.
Speaking of which, the colour blue is relatively rare in the botanical world, so if you see a dazzling new heather, orchid or cactus, shining out in the most intense "disinfectant" shade of blue, it's almost certainly been sprayed or dyed.
Blue moth orchids will revert back to their original white, but sprayed cacti and heathers, coated in a light-suppressing layer of dye, are unlikely to survive for long.
Finally, I have to flag up bonsai kits or, even worse, bonsai seeds, that promise miniature trees will sprout from their packets.
It's a training technique used to give the illusion of ancient trees on distant mountaintops.
They are almost always started from mature shrubs that are hacked back and new growth wired in place.
But side-step these ones and you may find one that actually has a chance of living up to its promise.

damn.
supportive.
I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.
When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it.
Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it’s in excess these days).
It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.
I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol.
It is DAUNTING.
I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.
I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet” is NOT the way to go.
I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.

Move the trailer!
No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it.
Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it.
You know we need to have access to the dumpster.
Me: but I didn’t park it there.
Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah
Me: It was not me.
The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way.
From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).
None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim.
If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.
Let me check this further for you.
Again we will wait 30 days for this payment to be made, after which the item will be disposed of.

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
It was spilled by our rider accidentally.
We will only send you a new order.
The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop.
These neighbors and I share a fence.
It separates our back yards.
I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc.
but this dog is insane.
I can't even use my yard at this point.
That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop.
I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence.
I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.
Like, I saved and invested in this.
When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up.
My speaker shakes the table.
It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.
The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it.
Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL.

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D
On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.
These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.
I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it.
How come we never saw the main shuttlebay?
We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.
We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space.
The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."
We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?

When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him.
I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on.
But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set.
He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however.
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.
There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.
The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen.
He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters

Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13-7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.
Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team.
Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench.
Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks.
For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.
Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle.
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13.
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing a brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.
I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question.
I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone.
I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it.
As well as every cart brought to the front.
Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.
Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc.
(Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go).
It's really dark, even upfront.
Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury.
Therefore, due to the spatial-temporal variation of AEE, emphasis should be placed on its core driving factors as well as the inter-parts agricultural cooperation in order to achieve high-quality agro-ecological development in China.
Key words employed were 'alopecia, caseous lymphadenitis, Chorioptes, dermatitis, dermatophyte, dermatophytosis, goat, lice, louse, mange, mite, pemphigus foliaceus, Psoroptes, ringworm, seborrhea, skin' RESULTS: Of 1,488 records reviewed, 358 (24%) goats had skin disease recorded.
Due to low endorsement of MST that involved assault, the impact of MST severity could not be examined.
Moreover, the levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> T, Th17 cells, and HMGB1, PTEN, PI3K in LDSDS were higher than SGDHS (p < 0.05).
CD4<sup>+</sup> T and Th17 are two representative immune cells that may serve as potential biological markers for LDSDS and SGDHS in CHB.
At week 5 post-injection, PAH rats were randomized to carvedilol (15 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup> oral; N = 16) or vehicle (N = 16) for 4 weeks.
Carvedilol did not reduce hemodynamic severity compared to vehicle.
RV ejection fraction (EF) was lower in both PAH groups compared to control (p < 0.05), and was not further reduced by carvedilol.
Carvedilol improved SNS function in the LV with significant increases in the HED DV, and decreased tracer washout in the LV (p < 0.05) but not RV.
PAH disease severity correlated with a reduction in HED DV in the RV.
We assessed benefits to southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) and superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) by eliciting from experts estimates of the probability of each species persisting in the landscape given a range of behavior-change scenarios in which uptake of the behaviors varied.
In this study, mitochondrial and microsatellite diversities were used to assess the contributions of paleogeological events, Pleistocene climatic oscillations, and contemporary landscape characteristics to the rapid intraspecific diversification of <i>Liangshantriton taliangensis</i>, a vulnerable amphibian species endemic to several sky-island mountains in the southeastern HMR.
Divergence date estimations suggested that the East Asian monsoon, local uplifting events (Xigeda Formation strata), and Early-Middle Pleistocene transition (EMPT) promoted rapid divergence of <i>L.
taliangensis</i> during the Pleistocene, yielding eight mitochondrial lineages and six nuclear genetic lineages. Moreover, population genetic structures were mainly fixed through isolation by resistance.
The paper concludes by focusing on how individual and community social capital relationships with mental health are contingent on measurement, scale, and rural or urban location.
Fifty-three client-owned atopic dogs.
The medical records of dogs with atopic dermatitis treated with oclacitinib twice daily for more than two weeks were reviewed retrospectively.
The planting area of maize hybrid in China has been stable at about 620 million mu.
More than one billion kilograms of commercial hybrid seeds are needed each year, and the annual seed production area has been stable at about 2.5 million mu in recent years.
So far, manual emasculation has been the major way of maize hybrid seed production in China, which is laborious and time consuming.
Therefore, it is the inevitable trend of development in the maize seed industry.
Severe neonatal episodic laryngospasm (SNEL) is an ion channel disease characterized by recurrent life-threatening myotonia of respiratory muscle due to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel genes.
The results of this study showed that more severe symptoms in PwSs were found to be significantly predicted by older age and nonmarried status at baseline.
In conclusion, this study shows the 21-year predictive effects of family caregiver transition on the mental status of PwSs but not the presence of family caregiving.
Initially, we collected abundant medical records with similar manifestations of COVID-19 in Chinese ancient times. The key words including wen (), yi (), li (), and zhang () were searched in ZhongyiZhiku (https://www.zk120.com/) from Warring States Period (475 BC-221 BC) to the Republic of China era (1912-1949) to locate ancient medical records according to inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.
Moreover, COVID-19-related manifestations and corresponding medications in those records were categorized.
Our study suggests that TCM might offer new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
The group difference at baseline underlines the psychosocial burden of infertility.
