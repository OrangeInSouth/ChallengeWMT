Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.

It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."

After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, one gets a feeling that the film-makers have set out to make a tearjerker, because even the hardest heart in the audience won’t be able to hold back the tears upon seeing the adorable cancer-stricken boy’s suffering.

Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
Okay.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
Many foreigners busk in the city centre of Tallinn.
It could be clearly see that the dreadlocked musicians wearing ripped clothing were backpacker vagabonds who would really benefit from a shower.

The third man next to them was sitting on a backpack and calmly smoking a hand-rolled cigarette.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
All of us have taken a spin on the dance floor to his record spinning,” he says.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
In that moment I felt chills.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
After a party with lots of drinking, a certain tougher breed of people find themselves thinking the hair of the dog that bit them might be a good idea.
Or they follow the maxim “avoid a hangover, stay drunk.”
Before and after alcohol, after the big party in the morning…or even instead of alcohol.
If you’re already experiencing nausea because of yesterday’s overindulgence, it isn’t a good idea to burden your liver with a big fatty meal.
And solyanka meat soup a bit later already.
Don’t count on pain relievers.
You will do even more damage to your liver and your hangovers will be worse in future.
Use humour.
At some point, every hangover will go away.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
The Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition conceived as revenge against the Centre Party, the Meie Tallinn coalition founded by Reform Party outcast Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE outcast Maria Kaljuste, and the Tegus Tallinn coalition of businessmen hoping to show party members their place – it appears that there will be just as many election coalitions, created at the initiative of those who have got their fingers burned in partisan politics, participating in this year’s local elections as there will be political parties.
The dwindling of his base can be seen in the events organized for the owner of his election coalition.
A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government with a Russian language pop song, featuring an appearance by the Lasnamäe district’s mayor; and a very primitive computer game in which the main character Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to ride a bike down a street avoiding puddles and squirrels along his way – is that how the Centre Party will try to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-olds allowed to vote for the first time?

Wolves teaching pups preying on sheep.
After a year’s respite, Hiiumaa farmers’ flocks are serving as “training material” again – wolves thought to be teaching their young to hunt have killed a number of sheep already.

Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
A GSM transmitter was attached to the leg of the latest young common crane on 1 August, this time on Muhu Island.

Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the 2011 world championships in Daegu, Šadeiko suffered a leg cramp in the last event, the 800 metres, and was carried out of the stadium on a stretcher.

Squats are the foundation of keeping legs and glutes in shape – who wants to take on the shape of a wave-smoothed sand castle over the summer?

From the Philippines to the wide world – straw bags journey into the hearts of fashion fans
Bags woven of straw are a summer classic that in recent years has become a hit product in its own right, which is de rigueur to hang on an arm for anyone properly enjoying the summer. Despite its humble origins, merchants have managed to tack on a price befitting a hit.
You just had it and if you didn’t, there was nothing wrong.
But now, straw bags are really taking the world by storm, and for the summer months, fashionistas have swapped their sophisticated designer bags for simple bags woven from straw.
Yet it would be wise to be certain whether such a summery style is all right with your boss or whether it would be good to stick your day-planner and laptop into a bit more official-looking case.
The amount of variety has made straw bags a real summer fling for women.
No doubt so that wealthier customers don’t have to feel that they are mere mortals promenading around with some cheap bags.

For instance, you can buy yourself a lady’s handbag woven from straw or even a tiny shoulder bag woven from straw.
It pays to remember that a classic straw bag will not go out of fashion, but a lady’s straw handbag will.
The type of straw bag that has been considered classic for centuries is reminiscent of a basket, open at the top, with short handles, also made of straw.

Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
“It’s not the distance that does you in, but the pace,” he says, intimating that nearly anyone should be able to finish if they go at a manageable pace.
Although Avandi was behind both Raio Piiroja (4:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (5:06:37), he did beat the other competitors in the “celebrity” category.
