New York real-estate tycoon, Barbara Corcoran, turned a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate business, before taking her expertise to the small screen, serving on the panel of investors on ABC's Shark Tank.
Laila Ali followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female in women's boxing as a four-time undefeated champion before adding TV host, author and speaker to her resume.
Yet despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx enlisted the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplishing lofty goals to a ballroom full of hopeful entrepreneurs.
Which Corcoron and Ali know a thing or two about: They may be at the top of their games now, but it wasn't a smooth road to success for either woman.
Ali entered one of the most male-dominated industries and had the added struggle of carving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global icon father.
To say the two are brimming with hard-learned advice is an understatement.
Then I start falling for my own baloney and I get inspired again.
I ended the business a year later, but for that year of my life - being the third wheel - it was terrible, because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt shot down, uninspired.
If only you could believe that when you're getting hit, which is the hard part.
But getting back up and starting the business all over again, minus the partner, was a very, very difficult year.
Laila Ali: I would say one of the toughest times I've had in my career was when I was in boxing, I was at the height of my career and decided I was going to get a divorce.
You have all this experience in the ring.
It was really just getting my mindset in the right place because everything kind of took off from there.
You felt like you really made it when ...
And I was able to attain that, not just one championship title, but four.
Barbara Corcoran: The one point that I felt like I made it was my eleventh year of business.
There's two pieces to it: talent and money.
So I wound up doing very well, as did my partners, over all the years with these great investors that I would have never had if I hadn't had the confidence to get some scrappy person who really wanted to hustle.
Anything that comes up, I feel like I can conquer it throughout the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I do prioritize.
And I put down what my A's are.
And I try to be okay with just accomplishing the A's.
Barbara Corcoran: I picture myself failing.
I think, "Oh my God, I'm going to fail."
I scare the living daylights out of myself and that gets me running hard.
I get competitive.
I envision it, where I can actually see it happening.
Going into the ring, seeing the fight happen, seeing me winning that belt, seeing me back in my dressing room celebrating with a slice of cake, which I always had.
That's where the preparation comes in for me.
Laila Ali: I am so excited to be a part of the T.J. Maxx Maxx You Project, because I feel like this is a way of paying it forward and giving back.
Because we all have that champion within us.
So we're going to try to focus them.
Laila Ali: I am in one of the number one male-dominated industries, boxing.
And I think I'm going to try to put a little flesh on the aspiration, for these women to really feel like, "Okay, I got it now.
Let me run.
Probably a bottle of water.
So I got it.
It keeps you on the straight and narrow.
I'm totally into it.
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the naysayers.
Naysayers come in all different forms.
They suck your energy.
I think of complainers as thieves.
Naysayers in any kind of a team situation will ruin the team faster than you could blink an eye because people who are at a pity party need other people to feel sorry with.
They suck other good people down.
Laila Ali: Be consistent.
So many times, we're like, "We're going to be on the straight and narrow.
We're going to do X, Y and Z."
So I think that you have to stay the course.
It takes finishing.
You start it, you finish it.
So many people are good at starts and not so good at finishing.
BAC of 0.05% obligatory for government officials
The ruling class doesn’t include only the politicians who are paid salary by the state, but also the self-aware people who engage in politics voluntarily (read: intentionally), wrote opinion provocations after the example of Mihkel Mutt, curse out their peers on Facebook as to how awful people around them here in degenerate Estonia live, picket, boycott, juggle, and sabotage.
They’re willing to live only in an echo chamber (the English-speaker’s word for people who live in a space where they hear only opinions they like to hear, such as their own Facebook friends etc.) but this is not possible in conflicted Estonia.
If they’re public comments are met by anything other than what they themselves sad, they are furious, insulted, offended hysterical.
The fact that in a number of European countries, people drive around in a car, head full of booze, and this is legal, doesn’t shake their opinion.
Luckily for them, we have a big enough bunch of claqueurs, stunt men with a deficit of spirit who leap through every window – without feeling any pain.
Some words that will definitely send us to the manor stable are homo, refugee, woman, violence, get to work, among many others.
If we believed everything that the selfless officials, activists and politicians (such people make up only a small part of all groups, but they are able to shout so loud so that the whole society becomes deaf), talk and write that citizens are not only nasty, vulgar and unpleasant but also mindless, with no brains.
But don’t believe them, don’t force them to tolerate it, don’t prohibit drinking.
Estonian people tolerate much more if they aren’t forced to tolerate things.
Estonian people won’t change their behaviour two months before the elections so that after the aim is achieved they can turn their back on their fad diet and yet again let in and also out of their mouth whatever quickly puts on the pounds in the form of fat on their brain.
To teach, it isn’t necessary to mete out fines, lay siege to, prohibit, coerce, call to order, make stand in a corner, hurl rotten eggs at people while they’re in the media stockade.
And then gets caught by a co-worker drunk…
Or will we learn that we ourselves want the most debased to govern us.
Because all of us, people of Estonia, are the people we absolutely never want to be ourselves.
In actuality, the shot is longer and the hot food doesn’t give off steam the whole time, as the steam comes from the high moisture content, which bread products for example don’t have.
Thus it may actually be shaving cream that’s on top of the cake or berries or in the milkshake in the ad.

“Christmas and New Year’s are the time for that!” someone is bound to exclaim, crossly.
Yes, in leading a vacation-free life, I end up doing a good amount of work, perhaps more than I would in some damned slaughterhouse, and I constantly feel fairly rested.
Mostly, I end up like a hamster on a wheel in the time leading up to Christmas – presents, at least four Christmas parties, a slightly heavier workload…
But a person who is weary and at their wit’s end isn’t capable of taking good decisions, to say nothing of improving on them in the form of a plan.

Raivo, who had energy for conversation, did switch to speedwalking a few times.
He was also able to catch his breath during the walking parts and perhaps that is why he was able to give interviews left and right without panting after crossing the finish line.
As if he hadn’t just swum 1.9 km, cycled 90 km and run 21.1 km.
I thought that it would be good if I weren’t collapsed in a heap after the Ironman.” On quite the contrary to lying in a heap, Raivo presented quite a different picture upon crossing the finish line: hands outstretched skyward and a sincere triumph shining on his face.
“My heart now belongs to the triathlon,” Raivo says, who shouted already at the finish that he has married his fortunes to running.
And less than two weeks before he died, he was at D23, a Disney fan convention, reminiscing on a panel about Disneyland.
"It was pretty heady stuff for someone just closing in on his 30th birthday and only six or seven years out of college," Mr. Sklar wrote in his autobiography, "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
Mr. Sklar wrote Mr. Disney's narration for the "Magic Skyway" at the Ford pavilion, with its animatronic dinosaurs and cave men, and was the main link to major corporate sponsors.
After Mr. Disney's death of lung cancer at 65, Mr. Sklar was thrust back into writing when he was told that the company's top executives had not prepared a public statement in advance, even though, as he wrote in his autobiography, "it was no secret Walt was dying."
Mr. Sklar resented having to write the statement that Roy Disney would sign, he said, but he understood that the lack of planning was a sign that Mr. Disney's death had paralyzed the company's leaders.
After high school, he had temporary jobs working at Douglas Aircraft, scooping ice cream at a hamburger drive-in and delivering packages for the Postal Service.
Mr. Walker asked him to interview for the job of creating and editing The Disneyland News.
It needed him.
"If Walt didn't like it, I was out the door, and he'd get a pro to do it.
Mr. Sklar eventually distilled Mr. Disney's lessons (and some from others) into "Mickey's Ten Commandments," a manifesto of theme park management.
Among the commandments: Know your audience.
Wear your guests' shoes, figuratively speaking, to experience an attraction as they would.
Bob Rogers, an expert in themed entertainment, once called Mr. Sklar "the sorcerer's apprentice" - the role Mickey Mouse played in the Disney classic "Fantasia" (1940) - for channeling the Disney philosophies to three generations of designers.
Mr. Sklar is survived by his wife, the former Leah Gerber; his daughter Leslie Sklar; his son Howard; and four grandchildren.
He routinely wore a three-faced Mickey Mouse watch (which gave him the times in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a gold Mickey Mouse ring.

It warned that without agreement, business faces "short-term chaotic cliff edges."
The IoD report Bridging the Brexit Gap: Options for Transition said: "Instead of dancing around the edges, this issue must become a policy discussion for the cabinet.
However, Gerard Lyons, an economist and leading figure in the Economists for Brexit group this week described concern about a "cliff-edge" Brexit as "alarmist talk" similar to the fear of the Y2K bug threat to computers at the turn of the millennium.
Prioritising interim arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of EU exit means the eventual opportunities aren't diminished by short-term chaotic cliff edges."

Plane traces perfect outline of itself over the US
A pilot has taken a passenger jet on a zigzag cross-country flight over the US - and even managed to have some fun with the route.
Live flight path data from the aircraft showed that its flightpath was more than just one straight line or arc, rather it was a series of flightpaths connected to resemble a plane.
"Rather than fly in random patterns, the test team got creative, flying a route that outlined a 787-8 in the skies over 22 states," a Boeing Company spokesperson told RT.com.
The last occasion was a few weeks ago on the royal family’s visit to Poland, where George wore a 10-euro blue and red striped dress shirt by the Spanish brand Tizzas. Parents caught up by the craze emptied out the brand’s online store in just 24 hours.
To begin with, the girlish blue of her youth.
Later, the heavy black kohl of her Martin Bashir Panorama interview, deployed to devastating effect as she gazed up through thick lashes and uttered the immortal line: "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."
Her eyes, huge and moist and outlined heavily in black against her gaunt, pale face, gave her the appearance of a wounded animal.
In public, she could be thickly painted.
She apologised, saying that if she didn't make sure her skin had the requisite sun-kissed glow and went out looking "normal," the paparazzi would take pictures and everyone would accuse her of looking "pale," "wan" and "exhausted."
Perhaps one of the biggest mistakes the Royal Family ever made was in thinking that, by approving her as a wife for Charles, they were getting themselves a pretty little brood mare with nothing but fluff for brains.
Otherwise, she had not the slightest bit of interest.
"What I do remember," she says, "is how relieved she was on the times we went on holiday together that she didn't have to put it on."
Careering down Loggers Leap at Thorpe Park in 1993 with her two young sons, she is drenched to the skin and laughing like a drain, her mascara pooling underneath her eyes like any other mother on a day out with the kids.
Four months since her separation from Charles was announced, at last she looks defiantly carefree and "normal."
Or zipping out of the gym in those later years, hair slicked back, toned legs encased in cycling shorts, face flushed from her workout, health and vitality oozing from every pore.
Her most sophisticated beauty products came from The Body Shop - Elderflower Under Eye Gel, for example.
Navy Elizabeth Arden mascara and that blue eyeliner, also Arden, completed the look.
Her brows are too heavy, and her eyes overworked in dull brown.
Most striking, though, is the infamous eyeliner - worn on the waterline, inside the eye - in that ghastly Disney Princess blue.
A fantasy shade for a fantasy bride.
She was sexy without meaning to be."
This was at the height of Diana and Charles's marriage woes and the beginning of the skirmish for public support.
"It was just so very ageing for her," she says.
As Anna Harvey recalls: "Once, when the papers were saying she'd had her nose done, she turned to me and said laughingly: 'Honestly, if I'd had my nose done, do you think I would have chosen this one?' "
One of her most memorable appearances - at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1994 wearing the famous "revenge dress," a daring off-the-shoulder, figure-hugging number by Christina Stambolian - shows her starting to crystallise what was to become her signature style in the final years of her life.
Hair short and swept back, up and over the ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her no-nonsense crop a sharp contrast to the very daring black silk dress.
A few months later, she flashed her elegant red manicure launching the Child Bereavement Trust at the Royal College of Nursing.
The Amami island chain, located just south of the southwest main island of Kyushu and some 1,350 km (840 miles) from Tokyo, will be hit by high winds and heavy rains from noon on Friday, with as much as 800 mm (31 inches) possible in the next 48 hours, the Meteorological Agency said.
Noru - which is a Korean word for a type of deer - is then likely to turn north and drench Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which last month were hit with torrential rains and flooding that killed 36 and left four missing, are likely to be spared the worst, an agency spokesman said.
Noru, at one point a Category 5 typhoon and an unusually long-lived storm, first formed two weeks ago and wandered in a circle around the northern Pacific before heading northwest and aiming for Japan, weakening as it approached.
It is a bit odd to call the mechanical mule a next-generation vehicle.
A platform with wheels, seat and a steering wheel: that’s it, end of story.
It is as if overzealous builders grabbed the blueprints from the engineer’s desk too hastily and started production.
In this regard, there was no match for the mule when it was put to the test in the jungles of Vietnam.
They re-emerged after the Twin Towers crumbled in New York and US soldiers found themselves in a shooting war on the desert terrain of Iraq and Afghanistan.
For example, reconnaissance or rescue operations.
The 750 kg vehicle is capable of carrying nearly its own weight in equipment – 570 kilograms of gear.
The modifiable shape compartment in the back, the sides of which can be removed, allows baggage to be transported from point A to point B that is even bigger than the small but tenacious bug.
The manufacturer claims these vehicles, which were first introduced and used for special operations, overcome the bottlenecks typical of ATVs in conventional use and also of the ones that have been modified for the army, in terms of handling, ruggedness and safety.
And it’s clear that in conditions where defence spending cuts are generally sought and smaller-scale operations aimed at a specified target is favoured over broad-based conventional warfare, light and agile small vehicles have joined the army in order to stay in service.
A 13-year-old boy is listed as being on bail and displaying sexualised behaviours, a 15-year-old girl who has issues with self-harm, substance abuse, and absconding is "out with the boyfriend" and "will not be returning tonight," and a 14-year-old boy is noted as needing help with "self-care" and being verbally abusive and physically threatening.
The spreadsheet appears to be a handover document which was meant to have been sent to an overnight supervisor.
The document also shows that a 17-year-old girl who is only three months from turning 18 and being released from residential care was considered to be such a high risk of attempting suicide that staff had to call triple zero immediately if she absconded.
It had troubling consequences the mother could have never imagined, such as her daughter racking up seven criminal charges within six months of leaving home, being moved hundreds of kilometres away, to a home and situation she appeared to thrive in, but then being moved back again without her parents being told, and the acceptance and facilitation by her daughter's carers of two relationships her daughter had with older men.
The first of these boyfriends, a 17-year-old who her then 15-year-old daughter had regularly been allowed by care agencies to stay with in a local hotel, ended when he was charged within days of his 18th birthday with child sex offences because of the relationship.
"Why was she left worse off than when she went in?" the mother said.

Sylvester Stallone is going to visit NBC's hit drama in its upcoming second season, executive producer Dan Fogelman announced Thursday during a panel for the series at the Television Critics Association press tour.
At the end of last season, Kevin scored a big acting job in a film directed by Ron Howard, who had a cameo in the show.
"This Is Us" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in series flashbacks, coincidentally played Stallone's son in 2006's "Rocky Balboa."
Fogelman said Ventimiglia's continued friendship with Stallone likely helped the show score the big-name guest star.
"This Is Us" returns September 26.

No case is more extreme than James Harrison, the 39-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker preparing for his 14th season.
"I don't need to do the checks and balances like that," Harrison said.

Actually, Karin didn’t really investigate the shiny object in the door of the washing machine at first.
“Two young children produce a lot of dirty laundry,” the woman chuckles.
When the next cycle ended and I started taking the wash out, the glint between the rubber seal the washing machine caught my eye and that’s when I found the ring.
Karin asked her oldest child whether perhaps she had found the ring outside, put it in her pocket, after which the ring ended up in the washing machine at some point, but the daughter said that she hadn’t brought any rings home.
Because her life is quite fast-paced with her two young children, the ring lay on a cupboard for a while, forgotten.
To be honest, it had me worried at first, but later, when other comments suggested that maybe I had been up to monkey business with the owner of the ring, that made me laugh.
Some commenters also suggested the idea that perhaps the ring had been in the pocket of second-hand clothing.
“Well, about six months ago, I did buy some second-hand slacks that I can wear to work, which I threw in the washing machine without examining them carefully, but really?” the woman muses to herself.

Australian codes are at the crossroads
The tortured delay in Cricket Australia reaching a pay deal with its players; the indecision of the Australia Rugby Union in sacking a team; the revolt by stakeholders of Football Federation Australia; rugby league's problems in achieving a functioning independent commission and the AFL's relentless push to be standard-bearers of social equity in the nation are evidence of this confusion.
By contrast, the inept leadership of the ARU by former NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne, in failing to cull an Australian Super Rugby team, has pushed the code back to its roots.
Rugby union boasts it has the most corporately qualified and diverse board in Australia, yet the failure of the code, when challenged by the demands of its international partners, exposes it as still too much of a sport to be a business.
The pendulum swung too far to business and the fans of the code have been seeking a saviour, one with a celebrated past in the sport, since.
A cynic might suggest this is done with an eye on government grants.
In the rush to recruit top business people, they have neglected what might be called the affection and affinity for a sport.
