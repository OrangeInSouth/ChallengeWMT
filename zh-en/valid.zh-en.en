As the World Cup comes to a close, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can’t ignore the Serbian Team, but the Chinese team will soon defend its championship.
As they fell behind, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team became more aggressive in their serves and attacked the first passer of the Chinese team, and meanwhile, the Chinese team members were only eager to attack, thereby making more and more mistakes, and finally, the Chinese team lost the round at 21:25 to their opponents.
To date, only 2 rounds in 11 of match play remain, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team nearly has the championship in hand, but the race against the Dutch team has truly sounded an alarm for the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team: the more critical the moment, the more effort should be made.
Judging from the current league table, it is essentially impossible for the Serbian team to win the cup, which means that they will feel no stress in the match against the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team, but they will also make every possible effort to attack the Chinese team, while the Chinese team, in contrast, will feel pressure to defend the championship, which could possibly affect its state.
Besides, the Serbian team, now consisting of backup players, is absolutely not a lamb for anyone to slaughter; in an earlier match against the Dutch team, the Serbian team played five rounds, and finally the Second Serbian Team turned the situation around and defeated the Dutch team, which was composed entirely of first line players, at 3:2, reflecting a very powerful lineup.

On September 24th, the "Take me on a trip with a cruise ticket" event was held in Juzizhoutou, Changsha, for which more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Star of Juzizhoutou cruise ship to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiang River, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the republic of China.
As China is about to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding, the media is turning its spotlight on the heroes who we barely notice in daily life so that they dazzle under the spotlight, because they are the ones whose brilliant efforts bring us warmth and light, and improve all of our lives.
Like an old farmer strolling in the fields, Yuan Longping, who devotes himself to hybrid rice research and cultivates a high-yield hybrid rice strain to prevent nationwide starvation; or Nan Rendong, a chief scientist who strives to open China's "eyes" (the world’s largest telescope, FAST), who has concentrated on one thing throughout his entire life, and who, as he eats dry steamed buns in the mountains of Guizhou, a remote area, looks similar to the old men who have experienced the hardships of life in that small village; or Zhou Ruchang, China's leading scholar of the classic novel A Dream of Red Mansions, who was once a rural boy who received a very late education and still had an innocent heart in his old age, and though he possesses a thorough knowledge of both China and the West, he doesn’t act like a scholar at all, instead appearing to the world as a man with disheveled white hair who laughs heartily when he encounters valuable ideas; or Qin Yi, whose fame as a filmmaker is overwhelming in China, and who still frolics in the grasslands for six or seven hours a day for rehearsal despite being over 90 years old, and was willing to perform as an anonymous old maid in “Legend of the Devil Cat”.
They seek their own virtue and live a simple but persistent life, and their passion ignites as they are immersed in careers which outsiders do not understand but which they themselves cherish, regardless of high position and great wealth.
Just like the floor-sweeping monk in the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple in Jin Yong's novel - though he is exceptionally skillful in martial arts, he is neither arrogant nor vainglorious, neither happy nor sad.
Behind every "floor-sweeping monk" and every innocent heart, one can see their deep feelings of love and responsibility for the country.
Ordinary people also sometimes have moments in which they become heroes, like Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai who shouldered the important task of judicial reform.
But at the annual meeting, he asked the old master of the reception room to come on stage and tell his story, and it turned out that the master sent and received countless newspaper and letters in a whole year without a single mistake, to which Zou Bihua said, "It isn’t easy to do simple things perfectly," and then led the judges in a round of applause for this "floor-sweeping monk".
Take, for example, things like FAST, which looked at today, seem like a miracle.
With so much waiting to be done in China, why would it invest money to listen to stars?
This is how FAST and all the scientists like Nan Rendong is amazing, as well as how China, which has foresight, stands high, and looks far, is also amazing.

Will wearing blackface pose an obstacle for Trudeau’s reelection plan?
It was Trudeau himself who dug the pit he fell into this time.
Trudeau lifted a rock only to drop it on his own toes.
To put it simply, it was Trudeau himself who dug the "big hole" into which he fell.
It was exposed that SNC Lavalin, a construction and engineering company in his hometown, had engaged in favoritism and committed irregularities, and instead of punishing the offender, Trudeau breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure SNC Lavalin avoided a corruption trial.
Although doubts still remained in the case itself, his interference is undeniable.
Observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau's reputation after five years in power was primarily caused by his own deeds, and that now he is paying the penalty for falling to fulfill his promise and exercising loose self-discipline.
The answer may disappoint him.
Based on media reports, we have calculated the time and cost of various transportation routes to this airport: 1) 50 minutes’ drive by taking the Jingkai Expressway directly to Daxing Airport Expressway from the South Fifth Ring Road, which will cost 40 yuan in total, with the highway tolls being 15 yuan; 2) take Daxing Airport Subway, for which the distance varies from 20 km and 30 km, and for which the ticket price is 10, 25, or 35 yuan; 3) take the Jingxiong Intercity Train, which takes only more than 20 minutes from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing Airport Station.

So, as we take account of the opening of Daxing International Airport, we should look beyond the mere benefits to individuals and see its greater benefit to society’s overall development.

But there have been rapid changes over time, and by adhering to the dual strategies of “bring in” and “go out”, alongside the drive provided by the One Belt and One Road Initiative, and by carrying out acquisitions, mergers, plant establishment, and other actions at the same time, Chinese enterprises have become leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
This relies on the ability to seize opportunities.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a bitter winter, and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises collapsed, but the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha went for “winter swim” instead of trying to escape the winter; they pressured themselves, achieved original breakthroughs, and have transitioned from manufacturing to smart manufacturing through the transformation of industrial structure, and so have not only survived, but also become more robust.
This is all thanks to the joint effort of governments and enterprises.

Get a suit, buy nutritional grain, pay my bills, and buy sashimi and snacks for Nana.
Nana hopped up to the passenger seat and lay restfully, she knew she gets carsick, and she was terrified, but she didn’t want to be without me.
My Moments was full of pictures of bright moon, and I realized that today was Mid-Autumn Festival.
The moon was hiding in the clouds, but fortunately, the clouds were moving and the moon flickered, light and then dark, slightly piercing my eyes.
My mind was flooded with all kinds of poems about the moon, but the only verse I could remember clearly was this one: every fifteenth day of the lunar calendar month, there is a full moon at night, and with moonlight shining on the barriers, the moon had just appeared in the sky, and the people were looking up.
Maybe we think too much about the moon, and for this moment, the sentence of "the things of god belong to god, and the things of Caesar to Caesar" feels perfect.
Curling up at my feet, Nana snored slightly, so I got up and spread Nana's little blanket over the edge of her little nest, after which she happily laid down on it.
I couldn’t see the moon from the bathroom window, I could only feel it, so I turned off the bathroom light and opened the glass window.

Agricultural Modernization in the Black Land -- Xinhua Net
In mid-summer, two planes that spray pesticides flew above the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Demonstration Field of the Second Work Station, Fifth Management Area, Youyi Farm, forming two white lines, and the large characters “The World’s No.1 Farm” were extremely clear as formed by the black rice seedlings in the green field.
