The World Cup schedule is coming to an end. Although defending the title is within reach, the Chinese women's volleyball team still cannot take Serbia lightly.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened their attacking serve in the situation of falling behind, which had an impact on the Chinese team's reception. In addition, the girls were eager to attack, leading to an increase in mistakes. In the end, they were pulled back by the opponent with a score of 21:25.
Up to now in the competition, there are only two rounds left out of the 11 rounds of matches. Although the Chinese women's volleyball team has already touched the championship trophy with one hand, the match against the Dutch team has indeed sounded the alarm for the Chinese women's volleyball team: the more critical the moment, the more we must give it our all.
From the current form of the points table, it seems that the Serbian team has almost no chance of winning a medal. This means that they can "go into battle lightly" in the match against the Chinese women's volleyball team, let go of their burdens and fully attack their opponents. On the other hand, the Chinese team carries the pressure of winning the championship, so their performance may fluctuate.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not a "lamb to be slaughtered". In the previous match against the Netherlands, both sides fought fiercely for 5 sets, and the Serbian second team eventually reversed the Netherlands' full main lineup with a score of 3:2. This shows the depth of their lineup.

Yuan Longping, dedicated to rice research, bred excellent varieties to feed the entire nation, eliminating the fear of hunger for billions of Chinese people. His contribution is immeasurable. In his daily life, he is like a farmer who enjoys wandering in the fields. Nan Rendong, the chief scientist who made China's "Eye in the Sky" open in anger, devoted his whole life to one thing. He lived in the deep mountains of Guizhou, eating cold steamed buns, just like the old men in the village. Zhou Ruchang, a sinologist, was a village boy who started learning late but remained childlike even in old age. He had a comprehensive knowledge of both Chinese and Western cultures and had a head of messy white hair. When talking about his studies, he would burst into laughter. Qin Yi, a renowned film artist, became famous at the age of ninety. She still endured six to seven hours of bumpy rides on the plateau every day for the sake of filming.

Zou Bihua led the judges to applaud this "sweeping monk" style old mailroom worker.
For example, "China's Eye in the Sky", now it seems to be nothing more than a myth.
China is full of untapped potential, why invest a huge amount of money just to play with stars?
Therefore, "Tianyan" is impressive, Nan Rendong is impressive, and the great country that embraces diversity and has a broad vision is impressive.

Trudeau's "image collapse", can he still be re-elected successfully?

It was exposed that the construction company "Lan Wan Ling" in their hometown was involved in a major case of serious violations, favoritism, and corruption, and they exerted pressure on the department and officials in charge of handling the case, demanding them to "go easy on them".
Although there are still doubts about the case itself, it is difficult to clear the suspicion.
Many observers point out that Trudeau's 5-year rule has led to the collapse of his public image, mainly due to his own "digging holes", with the biggest "pit" being his inconsistency, hypocrisy, and double standards.
The answer may be just one word: difficult.
According to the media's calculation of various transportation routes' time and cost to large international airports, if you depart from the South Fifth Ring and take the Jingkai Expressway directly to the Daxing Airport Expressway, it will take about 50 minutes by car, with a round-trip fuel cost of around 40 yuan and a toll fee of 15 yuan. Alternatively, you can choose the Daxing Airport Line of the rail transit subway, with a distance limit of 20 kilometers or 30 kilometers, and ticket prices divided into three tiers: 10 yuan, 25 yuan, and 35 yuan. Citizens can also take the Beijing-Xiong intercity train, which only takes over 20 minutes from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station.
From the perspective of trend development: The positioning of Daxing Airport is as a transportation hub for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Therefore, it is slightly further away from the city center of Beijing, but it strengthens the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, making it more convenient for more people to travel and of great significance for driving the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
Therefore, regarding the operation of Daxing Airport, we not only need to consider the individual benefits economically, but also the overall development.

The elderly migrant workers going out to work beyond their retirement age is not because they "cannot stay idle", but because they "cannot afford to be idle". They are driven by the helplessness and hardships of "having no choice but to do so" - whether it is to save money for their own retirement and medical expenses or to support their children. All of these factors compel these elderly people, who should have been able to "take it easy", to continue working hard.
The "elderly support" for overage migrant workers is not as easy as we imagine.
Being able to work for a day is a day, being able to earn a little more is a little more. The survival difficulties of overage migrant workers behind the phrase "cannot be idle" should not be ignored or neglected.
To solve the problems of unpaid wages and difficulties in wage collection, improve labor protection, reduce safety risks, increase labor income, and improve the living conditions of elderly migrant workers, besides their "self-redemption", the support and care from the public sector are also indispensable.
Speaking of air defense systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying various airborne targets, whether they are high-altitude, high-speed flying targets or "stragglers" approaching protected facilities.

It uses cultural relics with the theme of "Fushou" in the palace as carriers, allowing visitors to understand the profound Fushou culture of the Summer Palace through the exhibition, promote and inherit traditional Chinese culture, and convey beautiful wishes for blessings and longevity.

Their "hard power" can be said to be unparalleled and superior to others.

Through industrial structural transformation, they shifted from manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing. They not only survived, but also became stronger.
Relying on the strong support of both the government and enterprises.

From "grazing on the mountains" to "precision feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "judging by body shape and feeling the belly" to "performing individual B-ultrasounds"... In Qingyang, Gansu, sheep farming is not just a change in feeding methods. The model of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has also changed the scene of "raising sheep on the hills and selling them at the market". It has overcome the weakness and fragmentation of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, and the poor days of farmers have improved due to modernized sheep farming.

Everyone in my circle of friends is posting about the moon, turns out today is Mid-Autumn Festival.
The moon is hiding in the clouds, but luckily the clouds are moving, so the moon appears and disappears intermittently, which is a bit dazzling with its alternating brightness and darkness.
In my mind, there are various poems about the bright moon, but I particularly like this line: "Every time on the third and fifth, we reunite; the full moon shines on the jade railing; a round moon is just lifted up in the sky, and people from all walks of life look up."
Maybe we have given too much emotion to the moonlight. For me now, actually, the saying "Give to God what belongs to God, and give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar" is the best.
Nana Tuan had a slight snoring sound at her feet. She stood up, spread Nana's small blanket next to her little house, and Nana happily lay on it.
From the bathroom window, you cannot see the moon, only feel its light. Turn off the bathroom light and open the glass with a loud noise.

China's development relies on the spirit of hard work, where "800 million shirts are exchanged for one Boeing", with generations of people tirelessly working and making sacrifices that others can hardly imagine. It relies on the spirit of taking responsibility, where China does not export problems, shift contradictions, or develop itself by means of forced buying and selling or plundering other countries. It relies on the spirit of exploration, where China does not follow the old path of imperialism and colonialism, nor blindly copy the development models of Western countries, but instead combines China's reality, summarizes experiences and lessons, learns from human civilization, dares to explore and try, and charts its own path.
This is a path that is established based on the national conditions, prioritizes the interests of the people, promotes reform and innovation, seeks common development through openness, and governs the country comprehensively according to the law.

The problem of weak leadership in village party organizations and a lack of successors is prominent.

Black soil "cultivates" agricultural modernization - Xinhua Net
In the scorching summer, two crop-dusting planes flew over the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field of the second operation station in the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, leaving two white lines in their wake. The words "The First Field in the World" stood out prominently in the green field, where black rice seedlings were planted.
This farm is located within the territory of Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, the leading grain-producing province in our country.

In recent years, Heilongjiang Farming and Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a leading role in demonstrating and leading modern large-scale agriculture, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrialized operation.
