But in the opinion of Liu Yunlong, such people are not suitable to be spies, “Spies should be someone who won’t be recognized in the mass, and if he or she appears cool or handsome at first glance, he or she will attract nearly all the attention, so how can he or she hide in the enemy’s camp? There is a line in Kite, “If you hadn’t caught me, I would have nearly forgetten my identity as a member of Nationalist Party of China”, which shows how spies should not be presented as elites. ”
Therefore, in The Possibility of Victory, Liu Yunlong’s original idea was to design the hero Tang Fei as a comical “stuttering secret agent”.
These two skilled actors, one of whom comes from Northern China and the other from Southern China, invigorate multiple wonderful scenes in the TV series.
The director Yin Fei describes the performance of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong as “an acting battle”, “It was definitely a battle, they coordinated very well with each other, which was very moving for me. At many times, their performance was “improvised”, for instance, the script was only half a page, but without my disruption, they would continue their performance. ”
Masters don’t steal the show from others, and directors never disrupt a performance; all the actors were immersed in the characters, allowing them to not only craft the roles from the perspective of their characters, but also create more possibilities for the audience, and Yin Fei praised such performances as marvelous.
In the TV series, many familiar faces from “Liu’s spy TV series” can also be seen; for instance, three actors from the popular and influential “Mountain Town F4” in Kite have roles in The Possibility of Victory.

According to Da Peng, inspiration came from “accidents”, a series of family accidents during production, which changed the original production plan; the use of real-life performances without scripts was finally recorded as a film, creating a film far different from what he originally imagined.
There is no doubt that The Reunions is fully experimental: none of the cast are professionally trained, and the audiovisual style is quite creative, which transforms life into a movie, and composed of real-life videos, the audience will certainly find someone like themselves and their family, so that at the end of the film, it inspires deep thoughts.

Efforts were made to make criminals give up their takings and retrieve losses.
For example, the People’s Procuratorate of Beijing Municipality handled a loan crime case involving Lin, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed, and in the event that the properties might be disposed of by other cases beforehand, the first "Letter of Execution Suspension" was issued and sent to the relevant court in time, suggesting that the previous court executing the sealing order should put a hold on the handling of the properties involved, which will be disposed in a unified manner after the facts of the crime are ascertained, suggesting that all efforts have been made to recover the properties and retrieve the losses of the victims.

Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors - Chinanews.com
Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors
Each year, when we fill out our preferred majors on the NCEE (National College Entrance Examination), there are always students and parents who don’t understand the terminology involved, which can directly affect how you select your preferred majors.
What are “major point deductions”, and how do they impact your choice of major?
This means that all students who qualify for enrollment are ordered by a balanced total score, and if their score falls below enrollment requirements for their first preferred major, the university looks at whether the student qualifies for the second preferred major, and so on until the student’s final preferred major, none of which involves point deductions for any major.
“Major point deductions”, as they are called, are when universities apply one or several values calculated through a formula published in the “Admission Guidelines” to determine a student’s admission in a particular selected major; this value is called a “major point deductions”.
This refers to the point deduction that occurs between the student’s preferred major and another major, expressed by a point value, such as 3 points, 2 points, or 1 point.
Xiaoming, a student, applies to University A with an NCEE score of 560 and major preferences listed in this order: Computing, International Trade, Automation, Mechanical Engineering, and E-commerce, after which University A applies major point deductions of 2, 1, 1, and 0 points.
When allocating majors, if Xiaoming meets the admission requirements for his first preferred major of Computing and the major has remaining vacancies, he is admitted to the Computing major; if he is not admitted to the Computing major, he is considered for his second preferred major of International Trade with 2 points deducted from his NCEE score, at 558, and his qualifications are considered for that major; if he again fails to qualify, 1 point is deducted (for a total of 557), and he is considered for his third preferred major; if he further fails to qualify, 1 more point is deducted (for a total of 556), and his qualifications are considered for his fourth preferred major, and if he fails to qualify this time, no points are deducted when he is considered for his fifth preferred major, and so on.
As balanced major preferences become more popular, many universities have already stopped using major point deductions, but some universities still use this method, and from the “Admissions Guidelines” published by each school, we know that this year, major point deductions are applied at over 20 universities.
Some apply the same point deductions to every major, such as Ningxia University, where an applicant can expect to find 1 point deducted for each major in the order of major preference.
Jimei University, for example, applies a total deduction of 4 points, meaning there is a difference of 3 points between a student’s first preferred major and other preferred majors, among preferred majors after the first there is no further deduction by preference (meaning they receive equal deductions), and there is a 1 point difference between preferred majors after the first and non-preferred majors.
When reporting major preferences, students and parents must be sure to carefully read the university’s admissions policies to see if there are major point deductions, and while considering the point values, must also carefully consider their universities and majors of choice; if the university lists clear major point deductions in the Admission Guidelines, they should pay close attention to the point tiers of different majors so they can maximize their chances of admission.

Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.
As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where “slack students” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.
In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring “key tutoring” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.
Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.

Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive.
When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on?
Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year.
It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a delivery person.
Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.

The reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in the Qinghai Lake have increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
Report from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.
In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.

#PRS_ORG# can testify for me, no one took it after it’s prepared, and #PRS_ORG# wronged me saying I took it myself.

2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist.
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it’s necessary at all.
They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon.
Just like it if you don’t understand.
No need to say more, Huahua is generous.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel.
Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.
Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Come to Zhi Yun and enjoy a pleasant meal!
What I received is tripe.
Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.
They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.
When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.

It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.
It will take about half a month to edit all the photos and I look forward to seeing them~
This is the second time that I have won the chance to experience a photoshoot for free~ you may choose one from most of the available outfits to do the photoshoot.
After I arrived at the store, I filled in my name and chose the outfits; all the wedding dresses were available to be chosen; I tried on three or four outfits and they were quite patient; after I decided on the dress, they were doing my makeup for a long time and they were also nice during this time; later in the shoot, they would teach you how to pose; I felt my face was too big on the photo; they said detailed editing would take a month, but they sent them to me after three to four days, and they seemed not that different from the original photos.
These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
And got it wrong.

Because it is so raw that it is not edible.
To document the effect of surgical steps, including penile degloving, plate transection, dorsal plication, and fasciocutaneous coverage, in primary hypospadias repair on penile length.
SPLs before and after each steps or the entire operation were analyzed. The SPL was compared between plate transection group and plate preservation group, dorsal plication group and non-plication group, and plate preservation with plication group and plate preservation without plication group, respectively.
And there was no significant difference in increased length between patients with and without dorsal plication ( <i>P</i>>0.05). When patients with plate transection were excluded, dorsal plication resulted in no significant difference on postoperative SPL ( <i>P</i>>0.05).
The increased length of SPL after penile degloving, dorsal plication, or cutanofascial coverage was not related to the neourethra length, the rest dorsal penile length, the rest ventral penile length, the preoperative SPL, and the degree of penile curvature ( <i>P</i>>0.05). However, the neourethra length and preoperative SPL were the influencing factors for the increased length of SPL after plate transection ( <i>P</i><0.05).
The main steps in primary hypospadias repair can change SPL. The lengthening effect of plate transection would not be counteracted by dorsal plication. Dorsal plication makes no significant difference on postoperative SPL.
Cattle manure and pig manure were mixed with soils subjected to different reclaimed years (one year, R<sub>1</sub>; 10 years, R<sub>10</sub>; and 30 years, R<sub>30</sub>) at the ratio of manure carbon to soil mass of 4 to 100, so as to examine manure decomposition characteristics using the nylon mesh bag (15 cm deep of soil buried) in the Shanxi coal mine reclamation area, with no manure addition as control (CK).
In the following three months, 42 600 medical personnels and more than 9 000 public health employees were 'rushed out' of their own position and onto Wuhan and other areas in Hubei Province. They helped to strengthen the treatment of severe cases and the isolation of mild cases, and actively carried out community screenings, and eventually won victory in the defense of Wuhan.
During the normalization stage of prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19, China adopted the expanded preventive strategy by focusing on widely implement PCR testing, and integrate general and emergency departments to improve the performance of public health system. In this stage, China put out the cluster of epidemics that have occurred in several places one after another, and effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic in 2 to 3 incubation periods.
In the stage of 'dynamic zeroing', China emphasized the strategy of 'grasping early, grasping the basics', focused on specific measures such as precise prevention in key areas. The rule of golden 24 hours was used to control the spread of the epidemic within one incubation period.
3) The fungus with significant difference among restoration models were <i>Solicoccozyma</i>, <i>Cladosporium</i>, and <i>Alternaria</i>. Bacteria from <i>Norank_f_67-14</i>, <i>Rubrobacter_f_Rubrobacteraceae</i>, <i>Sphingomonas_f_Sphingomonadaceae</i> had significant difference among restoration models.

Infraocclusion is a phenomenon that the relative occlusal growth of a tooth stops after the period of active eruption and then the tooth becomes depressed below the occlusal plane. Infraocclusion occurred more commonly in children and the mostly affected teeth were the primary mandibular second molars.
The occlusal problem caused by infraocclusion may progressively worsen with age.
This review summarizes the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of infraoccluded second primary molars, so as to provide reference for the dental clinicians.
However, many components of the procedure remains unclear, including indications, contraindications, patient preparation, bile duct puncture, papillary dilation, imaging interpretation, and complication management.In order to standardize the clinic practice of PTPBD, Chinese College of Interventionalists organized a committee, including interventional radiologists, digestive physicians and general surgeons, and commissioned this criterion.
The most positioning points located on the highest point of the lateral intercondylar spine (62.07%) in the straight tibia group, while in the medial bowing tibia and lateral bowing tibia groups, most positioning points located in the area between the medial and lateral intercondylar spines (51.43%) and the lateral slope of the lateral intercondylar spine (57.14%), respectively.
It is feasible to use personalized extramedullary positioning technique for coronal osteotomy on the tibia side in TKA. Compared with the traditional extramedullary positioning technique, the personalized extramedullary positioning technique has a higher excellent rate of tibial prosthesis alignment in coronal position.
The main reasons for the shrinking situation of the service in acupuncture-moxibustion department include: the disease-based department division trends to divert many diseases suitably treated in acupuncture-moxibustion department; the environment pursuing economic benefits restricts the development of acupuncture-moxibustion therapy characterized by 'simple and low-cost operation'.
There are three important approaches for breaking through the dilemma of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy. First, modifying the traditional service mode as waiting for patients in acupuncture-moxibustion department and promoting acupuncture and moxibustion technology to be adopted in other departments rather than limited only in acupuncture-moxibustion department. Second, increasing the charges of acupuncture and moxibustion technology rationally. Third, positioning accurately the role of acupuncture and moxibustion technology in health services based on its own characteristics and advantages and promoting it in community medical institutions.
